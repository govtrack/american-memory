Whereas, according to the existing system, the President of the United States, instead of being chosen directly by the people, is chosen by the intervention of electoral colleges in the several states; and Whereas this system, besides excluding the people from a direct vote in the choice of President, is operated by the caucus or convention, an irresponsible body, unknown to the law or Constitution, where a few persons, by combination, and sometimes by intrigue or corruption, succeed in putting forward a candidate who becomes forthwith the exclusive representative of the party assures his election; and Whereas the caucus or convention, after being the engine for nomination of President, allowing the people little more than to record its will, becomes the personal instrument of the President when elected, giving him a dictatorial power, which he may employ in reducing the people to conformity with his purposes, and promoting his re-election, all of which is hostile to good government, and of evil example; and Whereas the existing system of choosing President besides being highly artificial and cumbersome, is radically defective, and unrepublican, inasmuch as it fails to secure for each voter the opportunity of declaring for the candidate of his choice, and in its operation, substitutes therefor the dictation of a caucus or convention: Now therefore, in order to supersede the caucus or convention, so that it shall no longer be the engine for the nomination of the President, or, when he is elected, the instrument of his personal will, and to abolish the electoral college, so that the people shall vote directly for President,",
