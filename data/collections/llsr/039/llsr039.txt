Whereas in a letter of instructions, dated July three, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, directed to General Torrey, commanding the French forces in Mexico, the Emperor of the French indicated his policy concerning the affairs of this continent by declaring that it was his intention to establish a monarchy in Mexico, ''which would restore to the Latin race on this side of the Atlantic all its strength and prestige; guarantee security to the French West India colonies, and those of Spain; secure the interests and establish the influence of France in the centre of America, and prevent the people of the United States from taking possession of the Gulf of Mexico, from which they would command the Antilles and South America, and so become the only dispensers of the products of the New World;'' and whereas in pursuance of said policy an attempt has been made to establish a monarchy in Mexico, contrary to the wishes of its people, and to support Maximilian in his usurpation by European soldiery; and whereas among other acts contrary to the spirit of the age and of humanity, the so-called Emperor of Mexico by a decree and regulations, dated September five, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, practically re-established slavery in his dominions, and by a decree, dated October three, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, has violated the usages of civilized warfare by denying to the Mexican republican troops the rights of belligerents, and ordering their execution wherever found within twenty-four hours after capture: Therefore--","Committee on Foreign Relations"
