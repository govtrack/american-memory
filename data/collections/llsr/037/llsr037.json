    "description": "Ordered to be printed. Mr. Powell gave notice of his intention to introduce the following joint resolution: Joint Resolution In relation to the arrest and imprisonment of Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, and John W. Davis, police commissioners of the city of Baltimore. Whereas the Constitution of the United States declares that no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation; that no citizen shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law; and that the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy trial by a jury of the district where the offence was committed; and whereas Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, and John W. Davis, citizens of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, were, on the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, seized without warrant and without any process of law whatever by a body of soldiers of the army of the United States, by order of Major General Banks, alleged to have been made in pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters of the army at Washington, and were removed by force and against their will from their homes to Fort McHenry, where they have ever since been, and now are, confined as prisoners; and whereas the said military officer, without warrant or authority of law, superseded and suspended the official functions of the said Charles Howard and others, members of the board of police of Baltimore; and whereas the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus has been treated with contempt, and a military officer (the predecessor of General Banks) has taken upon himself the responsibility of wilful disobedience to the writ, thereby subordinating the civil to the military power, thus violating and overthrowing the Constitution of the United States, and setting up in its stead a military despotism; and whereas the Congress of the United States regards the acts aforesaid as clear and palpable violations of the Constitution of the United States, and destructive to the liberties of a free people: Therefore--",

Whereas, since the adjournment of Congress on the fourth day of March last, a formidable insurrection in certain States of this Union has arrayed itself in armed hostility to the government of the United States, constitutionally administered; and whereas the President of the United States did, under the extraordinary exigencies thus presented, exercise certain powers and adopt certain measures for the preservation of this government--that is to say: First. He did, on the fifteenth day of April last, issue his proclamation calling upon the several States for seventy-five thousand men to suppress such insurrectionary combinations, and to cause the laws to be faithfully executed. Secondly. He did, on the nineteenth day of April last, issue a proclamation setting on foot a blockade of the ports within the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.
