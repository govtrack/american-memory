R. L. Canby, for permission to institute an action in the United States district court for the recovery thereof, and was refused, and was assured by said department commander that the possession of said cotton would be forcibly maintained; and Whereas when the United States returned said cotton to its lawful owner, said Henry Ware, it was deficient in quantity and inferior in quality, and was worth fifty-three thousand nine hundred and seventy-one dollars and sixty-one cents less than when so seized, and the United States compelled said Ware to pay excessive and unlawful charges on said cotton, amounting to ten thousand eight hundred and forty-two dollars and thirty-one cents, as the condition of the restoratian thereof; and Whereas the owner of said cotton having, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, instituted an action for the recovery of the difference in the value of the same at the time of the seizure and the time of the restoration thereof, and also of said excessive charges, against the agents of the United States, in a State court of Louisiana, the said department commander, on the twenty-fourth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, issued his order prohibiting said court from entertaining jurisdiction of said action, but afterward, on the fourteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized said court to entertain such jurisdiction, and the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States employed attorneys and counsel who defended said action, and judgment therein was rendered for said Ware for the difference in the value of said cotton when seized and when restored, and for the charges so paid, amounting in the aggregate to sixty-four thousand eight hundred and thirteen dollars and ninety-two cents, with interest and costs, and no part of said judgment has ever been paid: Therefore,",

Whereas our public lands contain mines of the precious metals which are unsurpassed in extent, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people; and Whereas a wise policy indicates that the revenue derived from our mineral lands should, to some extent, be devoted again to the much-needed development of that important interest; and Whereas Congress, by an act approved July twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro certain rights and privileges, which have been assigned, transferred, and set over to a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of California, and known as the Sutro Tunnel Company; and Whereas great benefits will accrue to the people of the United States from the construction of said tunnel, which, as a great geological survey, penetrating into an argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than has yet been reached by any similar work in the world, will establish the value of our mineral domain; and Whereas the principal wealth of our mineral regions consists in low-grade ores, which can only be utilized by means of improved reduction, concentration, and smelting works, for the erection of which extraordinary facilities exist at the mouth of said tunnel; and Whereas this work bears a national character, and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and the security offered to the Government is ample for the repayment of any sums to be advanced under this act: Therefore,",

    "description": "Mr. Nye asked and, by unanimous consent, obtained leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, referred to the Committee on Mines and Mining, and ordered to be printed. Reported by Mr. Alcorn with amendments, viz: Insert the parts printed in italics. A Bill To aid in the construction of the Sutro tunnel from the proceeds of the sale of mineral lands. Whereas our public lands contain mines of the precious metals which are unsurpassed in extent, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people; and Whereas a wise policy indicates that the revenue derived from our mineral lands should, to some extent, be devoted again to the much-needed development of that important interest; and Whereas Congress, by an act approved July twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro certain rights and privileges, which have been assigned, transferred, and set over to a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of California, and known as the Sutro Tunnel Company; and Whereas great benefits will accrue to the people of the United States from the construction of said tunnel, which, as a great geological survey, penetrating into an argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than has yet been reached by any similar work in the world, will establish the value of our mineral domain; and Whereas the principal wealth of our mineral regions, consists in low-grade ores, which can only be utilized by means of improved reduction, concentration, and smelting works, for the erection of which extraordinary facilities exist at the month of said tunnel; and Whereas this work bears a national character, and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and the security offered to the Government is ample for the repayment of any sums to be advanced under this act: Therefore,",

A Bill For the relief of Amanda M. Smyth, widow of the late Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth. Whereas Thomas A. Smyth, of the city of Wilmington, Delaware, on the breaking out of the rebellion in eighteen hundred and sixty-one, raised a company of men and tendered them for three months' service to the United States, in answer to the call of President Lincoln for seventy-five thousand volunteers; after serving three months, he returned to Wilmington, Delaware, with his company, and was mustered into the volunteer service of the United States as major of the First Delaware Regiment; soon afterward the First Delaware left for the seat of war, and Major Thomas A. Smyth, who was with the regiment in all its memorable engagements, was promoted for gallant and meritorious conduct on the battle-field, as follows: To lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two; to colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three; to brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and to brevet major-general, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and died at Burkesville, Virginia, on the ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, from wounds received at the battle of Farmville, Virginia, two days previous; and Whereas the said Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth was actively engaged in the military service of the Republic during the whole of the late civil war, until he fell at the head of his column mortally wounded, leading the advance of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the very last charge, and in the last great fight of the seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, previous to the surrender of the rebel General R. E. Lee; and Whereas the said General Thomas A. Smyth, while commissioned as major from October seventeenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, to December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, performed the duties of colonel and had command of the regiment; and when commissioned lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, and as brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, until the day of his death-wound, had assigned to him the command of brigades and divisions, and by alternates performed the duties of brigadier and major general; while acting as colonel he received only the pay of major, and while acting as brigadier and major general, only the pay of lieutenant-colonel and colonel; and Whereas the widow and child of the said late General Thomas A. Smyth are justly entitled, not as a matter of favor, but as a matter of right, to back pay for actual services rendered by him on the field, and which he would have received had he been commissioned according to his respective commands, or in accordance with the repeated wishes and earnest recommendations of his corps commanders: Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises,",

Whereas Northwestern Alabama contains a large amount of wild and unsalable lands which have remained on the hands of the Government for many years; and Whereas these lands are remotely situated from navigable rivers and railroads, among rugged mountains and difficult of access, and but poorly adapted to agricultural pursuits; and Whereas the inhabitants of this region of country have no means for the transportation of the fruits of their labor to and from the usual market, except by the common wagon over rough roads, at a great expense of personal exposure, time, and labor; and Whereas, for the causes above enumerated, this region must ever remain sparsely settled and undeveloped until brought under the influence of the only adequate means yet found for the development and utilization of such countries--the railroad; and Whereas this region covers an area equivalent to one hundred miles square, or ten thousand square miles, which must be traversed by the Elyton, Corinth and Tennessee Railroad diagonally, from the southeast to the northwest, for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles in the State of Alabama, and which presents no means whatever of adequate local contributions to the cost of constructing said road; and Whereas the said railroad is deemed of national importance by the great communities of the Northwestern and Southwestern States of the Union, connecting, as it does, the great railway system of the South, concentering at Birmingham, Alabama, from all the ports of the South Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, with the navigable waters and railway system of the great Northwest, thus bringing these two great communities of the nation into direct, cheap, and easy communication, by which they can exchange the commodities of their respective countries with great reciprocal advantages; and Whereas the said railroad will, by developing the natural resources of the country through which it runs, greatly enhance the national and State revenues, while it subserves the wants of the people as a desideratum to their progress, prosperity and happiness; and Whereas for the reasons above enumerated the said railroad cannot be constructed without some special basis for its financiering by which large amounts of cash capital can be attracted from other communities to aid in its creation, and which must remain unproductive for a number of years, as is usual in such cases; Therefore",

Thomas, twentieth district; M. H. Twitchell, twenty-second district, were elected senators for the term of four years, a term not yet expired; and that the said two enumerated classes of senators united make a number greater than a quorum if the Senate were full; that by said election-returns it appears that the following persons, namely, P. Landry and C. N. Lewis, of the parish of Ascension; J. J. Mellon and James Timony, of the first ward of the parish of Orleans; J. A. Shakespeare, J. A. Rice, and J. J. Finney, of the second ward of the parish of Orleans; E. H. McCaleb and Charles Montaldo, of the third ward of the parish of Orleans; T. B. Blanchard, of the fourth ward of the parish of Orleans; V.
