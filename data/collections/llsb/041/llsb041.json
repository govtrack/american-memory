Government deposits in the national banks throughout the country are so much capital withdrawn from industrial and productive interests and employed in speculative investments; such employment being a consequence of the short time allowed for deposits, necessarily producing a scarcity of capital and making rates of interest high in industrial and productive operations, which operations cannot be restricted in the use of capital to the time thus limited. Capital seeks speculative investment in consequence of absence of profits in industrial and productive enterprise. The great increase of value in city property, and the increase in the erection of buildings in cities, are no signs of general prosperity, but the reverse, as it indicates the absence of profitable employment for capital in industrial and productive pursuits, and its employment in the purchase and sale of city property, giving such property increased value. It is known that industrial and productive enterprises are carried on (if at all) with little or no profit, and as cities can only maintain their valuation by profitable business with the interior, it is clear that such apparently increased value has no solid foundation on which to rest. By concentrating in the treasury in New York all government income and individual and other deposits, and disbursing the same from day to day by loans and payment of government indebtedness, the equilibrium of the money market (interrupted by the withdrawal of money collected by taxes and retired into the treasury) will be restored, and the introduction of such government income into the money market in New York (where the rates of interest are correspondingly established for the whole country) will cause to flow from the treasury a steady and powerful stream of money, and so prevent a scarcity or too great abundance at any one time, and therefore of the employment of capital in speculation, as it is only on a scarcity, or an abundant money market at irregular times, that speculation thrives. Speculation is known to be greatest during the greatest fluctuations in the price of money. The great object to be obtained by a condition of specie payment is the maintenance of a standard and uniform value in the capital employed by the people in their various operations, and as the accumulation of gold in the treasury acts as a. forced check on the advance of the price of gold in the market, the same is rendered more or less ineffectual and fluctuating by the irregular flowing in and out of the treasury of the money received from the people in taxes. The loans and the deposits aforesaid will strengthen the treasury by drawing from the banks and otherwise the money now used in speculation. No operator or combination of operators engaged in speculation will be sufficiently powerful to check or hinder the more powerful movements of the treasury, and their capital, in the absence of speculative opportunities for investment, will seek the level of the rates of interest established for money by the treasury movements, which must gradually work lower and lower; and the capital taken from speculative investment will seek employment in the interior in the industrial and productive pursuits of the people, such employment (when high rates of interest cease) being more profitable and safer. By loans as aforesaid the government will derive a large income for the use of its unemployed funds, at least sufficient to pay for the management of the same, and nearly sufficient to pay the expenses of collecting the revenues, besides giving steadiness, greater abundance, and lower rates of interest to the money market.",

With the condition, that as a compensation to the Osages, for the stock and farming utensils which the United States agreed to furnish them by the second article of the treaty of January eleventh, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, and which were only in part furnished, the United States should pay the said nation twenty thousand dollars; and as compensation for the saw and grist mills which the United States agreed by said treaty to maintain for them for fifteen years, and which were only maintained five years, the United States should pay said nation ten thousand dollars; which sums should be expended under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the following manner: Twelve thousand dollars in erecting agency buildings, a warehouse, and blacksmith's dwellings, and a blacksmith's shop, and the remaining eighteen thousand dollars in the erection of a school-house and church, and the purchase of a saw and grist mill. Agreeing also, that all debts owing by the Great and Little Osage nation of Indians, and unpaid at the date of the signing of said treaty, either to whites or Indians, by said Osages, should be liquidated and paid out of the funds arising from the sale of the lands stipulated to be sold, so far as the same should be found just and valid on an examination thereof, to be made by the agent of the tribe and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, subject to the approval of the national council of the Osage nation in each individual case, and of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the amount so allowed and paid should not exceed forty thousand dollars: And provided further, That if the amount of just claims should exceed the sum of forty thousand dollars, the said amount of forty thousand dollars should be divided pro rata among the different claimants whose claims should have been established and allowed.

A Bill To provide for the sale of the diminished reserve and trust lands of the Kansas or Kaw tribe of Indians in the State of Kansas, and for the settlement of said Indians in the Indian Territory. Whereas the Kansas or Kaw tribe of Indians did on the thirteenth day of March, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, in a treaty negotiated by their chiefs, councilmen, and headmen, agree to sell all their lands situated in the State of Kansas, including the lands unsold, held in trust for them under the fourth article of the treaty of November seventeen, eighteen hundred and sixty, (being about one hundred and thirty-five thousand acres,) at the price of eighty-seven and a half cents per acre; as well as their diminished reserve more particularly described by the survey and plats on file in the Department of the Interior, being a tract about fourteen miles in length from east to west, and about nine miles in width from north to south, and containing about eighty thousand acres, for the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, payable as follows: Sixty-five thousand dollars within sixty days after the promulgation of the treaty, and the balance in four equal annual payments, with interest payable annually on the whole sum unpaid at the rate of five per centum per annum, with the condition that the United States should give to the said Indians for their future home a tract of land in the Indian country south of Kansas not exceeding twenty miles square. Said reservation to be surveyed under the direction of the Commissioner of the general Land Office, at the expense of the United States; and that as soon as practicable after the selection of the new reservation therein provided for, there should be erected upon such reservation, at the cost of the United States, a dwelling house for the agent of the tribe, a house and shop for a blacksmith, and dwelling-house for a physician, the aggregate cost of which should not exceed the sum of eight thousand dollars; and as soon after such selection of a reservation as might, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be deemed advisable for the Indians to remove thereto, (regard being had to the proper season of the year for such removal,) notice should be given to their agent directing such removal; and the expense of such removal, together with the cost of subsistence of said Indians for the term of one year after such removal, should be paid from the proceeds of the sale of their diminished reservation herein authorized to be sold; and that in order to promote the civilization of the tribe, one section of land, convenient to the residence of the agent, should be selected by the agent of said tribe with the approval of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and set apart for a manual labor school, and at any time hereafter, when the Kansas Indians should desire it, an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars might be taken from their funds in the hands of the government for the erection of a school building and the opening of a farm to be attached thereto. The United States agreeing to furnish the said Indians with a physician and necessary medicines, at a cost of not exceeding one thousand five hundred dollars per annum, and a blacksmith at a cost of not exceeding twelve hundred dollars per annum. Agreeing also that the sum of eighteen thousand five hundred and twenty dollars and ninety-three cents, with interest thereon from the first day of January, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, at five per centum, down to the date of the ratification of this treaty, should be appropriated and placed to the credit of the Kansas tribe of Indians to be expended in their behalf under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in establishing them in their new homes, and in the purchase of stock, implements of agriculture, and other articles necessary for their comfort and improvement, which said sum should be received as full compensation for certain money and property belonging to said Indians, appropriated to their own use by their agents, M. C. Dickey and J. Montgomery. Agreeing also, that as the Kansas tribe of Indians were desirous of changing their present mode of life and engaging in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, after removing to their new home, the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, now invested on their account as provided in the second article of the treaty of January fourteen, eighteen hundred and forty-six, together with any other funds accruing to said Indians under the provisions of this treaty, and not otherwise disposed of, should be expended for said Indians by their agent or superintendent, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as follows, viz: Fifty thousand dollars within three months after their removal to their new home, and twenty thousand dollars annually thereafter until the whole shall be expended in the purchase of horses, cattle, agricultural implements, seeds, and such other articles as may tend to advance their civilization. Agreeing also that an investigation should be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as soon as practicable, as to claims of the tribe for alleged losses and damages sustained by them by the unlawful destruction of their timber and other property by whites, and by the stealing of their horses and other stock; and the United States being bound by treaty stipulations to protect, the Indians from such losses, it was agreed that such a mount as might be found due upon such examination should be reported to Congress, and such amount, not exceeding the sum of twenty thousand dollars,should be paid to the said Indians, or expended for their benefit: Provided, That the amount awarded for losses of stock should be paid to the owners of the stock, if they could be found, otherwise to be paid as hereinbefore provided. And an investigation should be made of the books of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and if any amount was found due and unpaid under former treaties, the same should be added to the invested fund of the tribe and five per centum interest paid thereon. Agreeing, also, that the Kansas tribe of Indians, having, between the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, and the fifteenth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, incurred debts amounting to about twelve thousand dollars for outfitting for their hunt, clothing, provisions, and so forth, and since the fifteenth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, having been compelled to incur debts amounting to twenty-eight thousand dollars for subsistence in consequence of the officers of the army and of the Interior Department having expressly prohibited their going upon their annual hunt during that year, therefore it was agreed that an examination of all such debts which might be unpaid at the ratification of said treaty should be made by the agent of said Indians and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, who should report thereon to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and upon the approval of such report by the Secretary of the Interior, the debts recommended therein for payment should be paid by him out of the first money received from the sale of lands under the provisions of said treaty: Provided, however, That the total amount paid in liquidation of such debts should not exceed forty thousand dollars. And in case no provision was made for subsisting said Kansas Indians by the United States between the date of the ratification of said treaty and the date of their removal to their new home, then the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to provide and pay for their subsistence out of any moneys held or received by him for said tribe: Therefore,",
