Whereas the Union is in imminent danger of final dissolution, the consequence of a protracted strife and agitation about the institution of African slavery; and whereas it is believed that legislative remedies are insufficient to meet and remove the cause of this impending disaster; and as amendments to the Constitution can only be submitted by a vote of two thirds of both Houses of Congress, and owing to the unhappy divisions existing in those houses at present it is not believed that the assent of two thirds of the members of either can be had to such amendments to the Constitution as would reconcile the differences between the North and the South; and whereas it is a cardinal principle of our representative system that the representative shall obey the will of the people, it is deemed proper and necessary to ask the opinion and judgment of the people of the several States on proposed amendments to the Constitution, with the view of their submission by a vote of two thirds of each branch of Congress for the ratification of the States, as provided in the Constitution, thereby restoring our distracted country to its accustomed peace and prosperity: Therefore.",
