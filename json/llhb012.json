Whereas, by several statutes, pecuniary aid is extended to certain of the survivors of those who were engaged in the land or naval service of the United States, against the common enemy, in the Revolutionary war, thereby not only expressing the national gratitude to such survivors, but also making to them, personally, some further remuneration therefor, to the intent that the remainder of their lives might be passed in greater comfort and accommodation: Whereas, also, the whole object of those statutes was personal and peculiar to such survivors, and all such pecuniary aid granted for their own benefit exclusively, provision being made therein that the same shall not be liable to attachment or levy of execution, at the suit of any of their creditors: And Whereas those provisions for the benefit of those survivors of that patriotic army, who, under God, achieved our Independence, may expose them to a loss of liberty, by arrest and imprisonment for debts contracted under no expectation of such aid; and which arrest would not take place, but to wring from their possession, as the price of their personal liberty, what the nation has bestowed upon them as a testimonial of their meritorious service: Therefore,",
