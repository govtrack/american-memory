Whereas the President of the United States, by his proclamation issued on the first day of January, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, as commander-in-chief of the army thereof, did, as a fit and lawful means of suppressing the rebellion, in accordance with the laws of war and with the dictates of justice and humanity, order, proclaim, and declare that all persons held as slaves within the limits of certain States and parts of States therein designated, were, and should thereafter and forever be, free, and that the executive, military, and naval authorities would and should thenceforward recognize and maintain the freedom of all such persons, and whereas, by said proclamation and order, the President has guaranteed to all such persons their freedom, and has pledged the faith and honor of the country that their freedom shall be recognized and forever maintained; and whereas it is the right and the duty of Congress to make all laws which may be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all the powers, whether civil or military, vested by the Constitution in the President as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, and among such military powers is that of making and executing the proclamation aforesaid; and whereas all persons heretofore held as slaves as aforesaid, within said designated States and parts of States, are now of right free, and ought to be hereafter forever unmolested in the enjoyment of that freedom, which the government of the United States is bound to ''recognize and maintain:'' Now, therefore, for the purpose of carrying into more complete and immediate execution the aforesaid proclamation, and to secure forever the recognition and maintenance of the freedom of all persons designated therein, and thereby to provide more effectually for the suppression of rebellion, the securing of domestic tranquillity, the maintaining of the common defence, and the preservation of the liberties of the people--",
