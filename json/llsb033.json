Whereas, the legislature of the State of Kentucky did, by their act of the twenty-first February, eighteen hundred and forty-two, authorize the directors of the Louisville and Portland Canal Company, with the approbation of the stockholders, to appropriate the net income of the company in purchasing up the shares other than those owned by the United States, on certain terms and conditions until the whole were purchased, when they were to be transferred to the United States, on condition that the latter in future should levy tolls for the use of said canal only sufficient to keep the same in repair, to pay all necessary superintendence, custody, and expenses, and make all necessary improvements; and whereas it will be more consistent with the powers reserved to the individual States, that the State of Kentucky should exercise over the Louisville and Portland canal, located within its territorial jurisdiction, the powers which its legislature were willing should be exercised by the United States; and whereas Congress desires to aid that State in extinguishing all the stock, and in making that canal as free to commerce as practicable, and are willing to cancel and relinquish all the stock in that company held by the United States, but decline levying tolls or other charges, or assuming any permanent local jurisdiction within a State of the nature proposed, or for purposes not expressly warranted by the Constitution, therefore--",
