Mr. Bell asked and obtained leave to submit to the House the following bill: A Bill To secure the freedom of elections. Whereas complaints are made that officers of the United States, or persons holding offices or employments under the authority of the same, other than the heads of the chief Executive Departments, or such officers as stand in the relation of constitutional advisers of the President, have been removed from office, or dismissed from their employment, upon political grounds, or for opinion's sake; and whereas such a practice is manifestly a violation of the freedom of elections, an attack upon the public liberty, and a high misdemeanor: and Whereas complaints are also made that officers of the United States, or persons holding offices or employments under the authority of the same, are in the habit of intermeddling in elections, both State and Federal, otherwise than by giving their votes; and whereas such a practice is a violation of the freedom of elections, and a gross abuse, which ought to be discountenanced by the appointing power, and prohibited by law: and Whereas complaints are also made that, pending the late election of President and Vice President of the United States, offices and employments were distributed and conferred, in many instances, under circumstances affording a strong presumption of corruption, or that they were conferred as the inducements to, or the reward of, influence, employed or to be employed in said election; and whereas such a practice, in the administration of the patronage of the Government, will speedily destroy the purity and freedom of the elective franchise and undermine the free system of Government now happily established in these United States: therefore, to prevent the recurrence of any practices which may give rise to similar complaints in future,",
