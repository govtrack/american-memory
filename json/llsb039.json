    "description": "Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered to be printed. A Bill To warrant and confirm the land titles of grantees under the field order of Major General Sherman at Savannah, January sixteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-five. Whereas Major General Sherman, of the army of the United States, by special field order number fifteen, dated in the field, Savannah, Georgia, January sixteen, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, reserved and set apart certain lands for the settlement of the negroes made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States, which order, so far as it relates to this subject was as follows: ''I. The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the Saint John's river, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States. ''II. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina, Saint Augustine, and Jacksonville the blacks may remain in their chosen or accustomed vocations; but on the islands and in the settlements hereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldier detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the United States military authority and the acts of Congress. ''III. Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of families, shall desire to settle on land, and shall have selected for that purpose an island, or a locality clearly defined, within the limits above designated, the inspector of settlements and plantations will himself, or by such subordinate officer as he may appoint, give them a license to settle such island or district, and afford them such assistance as he can to enable them to establish a peaceable agricultural settlement. The three parties named will subdivide the land, under the supervision of the inspector, among themselves and such others as may choose to settle near them, so that each family shall have a plot of not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground, and when it borders on some water channel with not more than eight hundred (800) feet water front, in the possession of which land the military authorities will afford them protection until such time as they can protect themselves, or until Congress shall regulate their title. ''IV. Whenever a negro has enlisted in the military service of the United States, he may locate his family in any one of the settlements at pleasure, and acquire a homestead and all other rights and privileges of a settler as though present in person. In like manner, negroes may settle their families and engage on board the gunboats, or in fishing, or in the navigation of the inland waters without losing any claim to land or other advantages derived from this system. But no one unless an actual settler as above defined, or unless absent on government service will be entitled to claim any right to land or property in any settlement by virtue of these orders. ''V. In order to carry out this system of settlement, a general officer will be detailed as inspector of settlements and plantations, whose duty it shall be to visit the settlements, to regulate their police and general management, and who will furnish personally to each head of a family, subject to the approval of the President of the United States a possessory title in writing, giving as near as possible the description of boundaries, and who shall adjust all claims or conflicts that may arise under the same, subject to the like approval, treating such titles altogether as possessory.'' And whereas the faith of the nation is pledged to the grantees who have entered upon such lands in pursuance of this order: Therefore--",

Whereas by an act of the general assembly of Virginia, entitled ''An act giving the consent of the State of Virginia to the county of Berkeley being admitted into and becoming a part of the State of West Virginia,'' passed January thirty-one, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, it was provided that polls should be opened and held in the said county of Berkeley on the fourth Thursday in May, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, for the purpose of taking the sense of the qualified voters of said county on the question of including the said county in the said State of West Virginia, the result of which election should be certified by the governor of Virginia to the governor of the State of West Virginia, and if a majority of the votes given at the polls opened and held pursuant to said act was in favor of the said county of Berkeley becoming part of the State of West Virginia, then the said county should become part of the said State of West Virginia, when admitted into the same with the consent of the legislature thereof; whereas F. H. Pierpoint, governor of the State of Virginia, in conformity with the requirements of the act aforesaid, did, on the twenty-second day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, under the less seal of the commonwealth of Virginia, certify to the governor of the State of West Virginia that a very large majority of the votes cast at the election aforesaid were in favor of the said county of Berkeley becoming part of the State of West Virginia; whereas by another act of the general assembly of Virginia, entitled ''An act giving consent to the admission of certain counties into the new State of West Virginia, upon certain conditions,'' passed February four, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, it was, among other things, provided that it should be lawful for the voters of the county of Jefferson, at the general election on the fourth Thursday in May, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, to declare by their votes whether the said county of Jefferson should be annexed to and become a part of the State of West Virginia, and that the consent of the general assembly of Virginia was thereby given for the said annexation of the said county of Jefferson, if a majority of the votes polled therein should be in favor thereof, provided that the legislature of West Virginia should also consent and agree to said annexation, after which all jurisdiction of Virginia over the same should cease; whereas, in conformity with a further provision of the act last aforesaid, requiring the governor of the commonwealth of Virginia to ascertain and certify the result of said election in said county of Jefferson, F.

Whereas thirty miles of the eastern portion of the grant of lands made by Congress, to wit, from Tomah to Black River Falls, to aid in constructing a railroad from the town of Tomah, in the State of Wisconsin, to the Saint Croix river or lake, and thence to Superior and Bayfield, is a poor scrub-pine sandy barren, unfit for cultivation and of no value. Not only will the railroad not get any lands of any value, but the country through which it passes never can produce anything to support the road, but it is necessary to build the railroad through this sand to reach and accommodate the fine country further west; whereas, the grant of lands made by Congress to the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers Improvement Company, prior to the said grants for railroad purposes, gave permission to said company to locate or take any government lands in any part of said State, have selected a large amount of the best lands within the limits of said railroad grants, to wit, over one hundred thousand acres; whereas, there will be a deficiency of over two hundred thousand acres of land called for by the aforesaid grants by Congress for railroad purposes, and there is only about two hundred thousand acres of refuse lands, which have been long in market, subject to entry within the ten miles limits on the line of the Tomah and Lake Saint Croix railroad, undisposed of by the government; whereas, all the material used in the building of railroads and labor is more than double the price before the war, and it is of the utmost importance to the people of the great northwest that these railroads should be built in the shortest possible time: Now, therefore,",

Whereas it is expedient that the States lately in insurrection should, at the earliest day consistent with the future peace and safety of the Union, be restored to full participation in all political rights; and whereas the Congress did, by joint resolution, propose for ratification to the legislatures of the several States, as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, an article in the following words, to wit: ''Article --. ''Section 1. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. ''Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States, which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But whenever, in any State, the elective franchise shall be denied to any portion of its male citizens not less than twenty-one years of age, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation in such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens not less than twenty-one years of age. ''Section 3. Until the fourth day of July, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, all persons who voluntarily adhered to the late insurrection, giving it aid and comfort, shall be excluded from the right to vote for representatives in Congress and for electors for President and Vice-President of the United States. ''Section 4. Neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation already incurred, or which may hereafter be incurred, in aid of insurrection or of war against the United States, or any claim for compensation for loss of involuntary service or labor.

A Bill To provide for restoring to the States lately in insurrection their full political rights. Whereas it is expedient that the States lately in insurrection should, at the earliest day consistent with the future peace and safety of the Union, be restored to full participation in all political rights; and whereas the Congress did, by joint resolution, propose for ratification to the legislatures of the several States, as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, an article in the following words, to wit: Article XIV. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Sec. 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. Sec. 3. No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each house, remove such disability. Sec. 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and void. Sec. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Now, therefore,",
