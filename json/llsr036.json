Resumed, and on motion by Mr. Saulsbury, that it be referred to the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, Ordered, That the resolution be printed, with the amendment intended to be proposed by Mr. Fitch. Joint Resolution Concerning the First Comptroller of the Treasury, William Medill. Whereas the Congress of the United States, by the sixth section of the Post Office appropriation act, approved August eighteen, eighteen hundred and fifty-six, enacted as follows: ''the First Comptroller of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, required to adjust the damages due to Edward H. Carmick and Albert C. Ramsey, on account of the abrogation by the Postmaster General of their contract to carry the mail on Vera Cruz, Acapulco, and San Francisco route, dated the fifteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and fifty-three, to adjudge and award them, according to the principles of law, equity, and justice, the amount as found due, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby required to pay the same to the said Carmick and Ramsey, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated;'' and whereas it is the judgment of Congress that the law aforesaid declared the fact that a contract existed as stated in the said law, involving the interests of said Carmick and Ramsey, and further determined that damages had had accrued to them by reason of the abrogation of said contract by the Postmaster General aforesaid; and whereas it is the further judgment of Congress that there was imposed on the said Comptroller of the Treasury, by the said laws, the imperative duty of proceeding to ascertain and adjust the said damages, in accordance with the principles of ''law, equity, and justice;'' and whereas William Medill, First Comptroller of the Treasury, instead of proceeding to execute said law of Congress aforesaid, did undertake to affirm and decide that said contract was never abrogated, thereby intending to defeat the clearly expressed will of Congress, and has set at defiance the will of his predecessor, the Hon. Elisha Whittlesey; and whereas, in doing so, the said William Medill has assumed the prerogative of nullifying the will and opinion of Congress, by them solemnly declared, and has practically refused to obey the order of Congress, as he was bound in duty to have done: Therefore,",

    "description": "Mr. Crittenden, from the select committee of five, reported the following joint resolution; which was read and passed to a second reading, and postponed to and made the special order for Friday, March 1, at 12 1/2 o'clock. Joint Resolution Proposing certain amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Whereas, commissioners, appointed on the invitation of the State of Virginia, by the following States, respectively: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Kansas, have met in convention at the city of Washington, for the purpose of considering the distracted and perilous condition of the country, and proposing measures for the preservation of the peace, the safety of the people, and the security of the Union, and having performed that duty, and communicated to Congress the result of their deliberations, with a request and recommendation on the part and in the name of said States, that the following be proposed to the several States as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, according to the fifth article of said instrument, namely: Article thirteen. Section]. In all the present territory of the United States, north of the parallel of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes of north latitude, involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime, is prohibited. In all the present territory south of that line, the status of persons held to involuntary service or labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be passed by Congress or the territorial legislature to hinder or prevent the taking of such persons from any of the States of this Union to said territory, nor to impair the rights arising from said relation; but the same shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the federal courts, according to the course of the common law. When any territory north or south of said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe, shall contain a population equal to that required for a member of Congress, it shall, if its form of government be republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States, with or without involuntary servitude, as the Constitution of such State may provide. Sec. 2. No territory shall be acquired by the United States, except by discovery and for naval and commercial stations, depots, and transit routes, without the concurrence of a majority of all the Senators from States which allow involuntary servitude, and a majority of all the Senators from States which prohibit that relation; nor shall territory be acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a majority of the Senators from each class of States hereinbefore mentioned be cast as a part of the two-thirds majority necessary to the ratification of such treaty. Sec. 3. Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment thereof, shall be construed to give Congress power to regulated, abolish, or control within any State the relation established or recognized by the laws thereof touching persons held to labor or involuntary service therein, nor to interfere with or abolish involuntary service in the District of Columbia without the consent of Maryland and without the consent of the owners, or making the owners who do not consent just compensation; nor the power to interfere with or prohibit representatives and others from bringing with them to the District of Columbia, retaining and taking away, persons so held to labor or service; nor the power to interfere with or abolish involuntary service in places under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States within those States and Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor the power to prohibit the removal or transportation of persons held to labor or involuntary service in any State or Territory of the United States to any other State or Territory thereof where it is established or recognized by law or usage; and the right during transportation, by sea or river, of touching at ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in case of distress, shall exist; but not the right of transit in or through any State or Territory, or of sale or traffic, against the laws thereof. Nor shall Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation on persons held to labor or service than on land. The bringing into the District of Columbia of persons held to labor or service, for sale, or placing them in depots to be afterwards transferred to other places for sale as merchandise, is prohibited. Sec. 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and through the action of their judicial and ministerial officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from labor to the persons to whom such service or labor is due. Sec. 5. The foreign slave trade is hereby forever prohibited; and it shall be the duty of Congress to pass laws to prevent the importation of slaves, coolies, or persons held to service or labor, into the United States and the Territories from places beyond the limits thereof. Sec. 6. The first, third, and fifth sections, together with this section of these amendments, and the third paragraph of the second section of the first article of the Constitution, and the third paragraph of the second section of the fourth article thereof, shall not be amended or abolished without the consent of all the States. Sec. 7. Congress shall provide by law that the United States shall pay to the owner the full value of his fugitive from labor, in all cases where the marshal, or other officer, whose duty it was to arrest such fugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation from mobs or riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such fugitive was rescued by like violence or intimidation, and the owner thereby deprived of the same; and the acceptance of such payment shall preclude the owner from further claim to such fugitive. Congress shall provide by law for securing to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.",
