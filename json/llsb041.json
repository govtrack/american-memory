    "description": "Mr. Sprague asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, ordered to lie on the table, and be printed. A Bill To provide for loaning the public money, and for other purposes. The liberties and interests of the American people imperatively demand that scarcity of capital and high rates of interest for money shall cease. Government deposits in the national banks throughout the country are so much capital withdrawn from industrial and productive interests and employed in speculative investments; such employment being a consequence of the short time allowed for deposits, necessarily producing a scarcity of capital and making rates of interest high in industrial and productive operations, which operations cannot be restricted in the use of capital to the time thus limited. Capital seeks speculative investment in consequence of absence of profits in industrial and productive enterprise. The great increase of value in city property, and the increase in the erection of buildings in cities, are no signs of general prosperity, but the reverse, as it indicates the absence of profitable employment for capital in industrial and productive pursuits, and its employment in the purchase and sale of city property, giving such property increased value. It is known that industrial and productive enterprises are carried on (if at all) with little or no profit, and as cities can only maintain their valuation by profitable business with the interior, it is clear that such apparently increased value has no solid foundation on which to rest. By concentrating in the treasury in New York all government income and individual and other deposits, and disbursing the same from day to day by loans and payment of government indebtedness, the equilibrium of the money market (interrupted by the withdrawal of money collected by taxes and retired into the treasury) will be restored, and the introduction of such government income into the money market in New York (where the rates of interest are correspondingly established for the whole country) will cause to flow from the treasury a steady and powerful stream of money, and so prevent a scarcity or too great abundance at any one time, and therefore of the employment of capital in speculation, as it is only on a scarcity, or an abundant money market at irregular times, that speculation thrives. Speculation is known to be greatest during the greatest fluctuations in the price of money. The great object to be obtained by a condition of specie payment is the maintenance of a standard and uniform value in the capital employed by the people in their various operations, and as the accumulation of gold in the treasury acts as a. forced check on the advance of the price of gold in the market, the same is rendered more or less ineffectual and fluctuating by the irregular flowing in and out of the treasury of the money received from the people in taxes. The loans and the deposits aforesaid will strengthen the treasury by drawing from the banks and otherwise the money now used in speculation. No operator or combination of operators engaged in speculation will be sufficiently powerful to check or hinder the more powerful movements of the treasury, and their capital, in the absence of speculative opportunities for investment, will seek the level of the rates of interest established for money by the treasury movements, which must gradually work lower and lower; and the capital taken from speculative investment will seek employment in the interior in the industrial and productive pursuits of the people, such employment (when high rates of interest cease) being more profitable and safer. By loans as aforesaid the government will derive a large income for the use of its unemployed funds, at least sufficient to pay for the management of the same, and nearly sufficient to pay the expenses of collecting the revenues, besides giving steadiness, greater abundance, and lower rates of interest to the money market.",

A Bill To authorize the Postmaster General to contract with certain parties and their successors and assigns for the transport of the mails between the United States and Europe in American steamers. Whereas the revenues arising from the European postal service are at present paid to foreign ship-owners for the performance of such service, instead of being made available for the establishment and support of American lines of steamers and the encouragement of American enterprise in constructing and navigating such steamers; and whereas it is inexpedient to make a specific grant for a term of years to private parties or companies of ocean postages, whereby the government would be prevented from making further reductions in the rates of such postages during the term so specified; and whereas Francis Skiddy, I. Hatheway, Charles Luling, Lester M. Clark, C. M. Saunderson, Carlos Pierce, Isaac Taylor, George R. Sampson, I. Kennedy Smyth, David Gibson, Robert B. Barle, Charles A. Secor, Cornelius H. Bushnell, Thomas Scott, George W. Swepson, John B Clark, Charles L. Frost, citizens of the United States, have by their memorial proposed to build, equip, man, and navigate a sufficient number of first-class steamships to perform, in the first instance, a weekly mail service between certain American and certain European ports, and have prayed for the passage of an act to authorize the Postmaster General to enter into a contract with them or with such company as they may form under the laws of the State of New York: Therefore,",

Whereas the Great and Little Osage Indians did, on the twenty-seventh day of May, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, in a treaty negotiated and signed on said day by the chiefs, councilmen, and headmen, agree to sell all their lands situated in the State of Kansas, including their trust lands, as well as their diminished reservation, for the sum of one million six hundred thousand dollars, to be held in trust by the government of the United States, and bear interest at the rate of five per centrum per annum, payable semi-annually as follows, to-wit: The interest on one hundred thousand dollars to be paid for the support of schools in said nation; the interest on three hundred thousand dollars to be paid in cash for national purposes, five thousand two hundred dollars thereof to be paid as compensation to the chiefs and councilors of the nation; five thousand to be expended for the encouragement of agriculture, to be paid pro rata to each head of a family in proportion to the number of acres cultivated and improvements made thereon by individual members of the tribe, the object being to encourage real industry among them; the remaining four thousand eight hundred dollars to be expended under the direction of the council and agent for the tribe in the payment of such other expenses as may be necessary for the benefit and support of their national government; and the interest on the balance to be paid to the members of the nation per capita, or to the council for distribution in money, goods, provisions, and other articles of necessity, as the council of the nation and the agent of the tribe may recommend, under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. With the condition, that as a compensation to the Osages, for the stock and farming utensils which the United States agreed to furnish them by the second article of the treaty of January eleventh, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, and which were only in part furnished, the United States should pay the said nation twenty thousand dollars; and as compensation for the saw and grist mills which the United States agreed by said treaty to maintain for them for fifteen years, and which were only maintained five years, the United States should pay said nation ten thousand dollars; which sums should be expended under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the following manner: Twelve thousand dollars in erecting agency buildings, a warehouse, and blacksmith's dwellings, and a blacksmith's shop, and the remaining eighteen thousand dollars in the erection of a school-house and church, and the purchase of a saw and grist mill. Agreeing also, that all debts owing by the Great and Little Osage nation of Indians, and unpaid at the date of the signing of said treaty, either to whites or Indians, by said Osages, should be liquidated and paid out of the funds arising from the sale of the lands stipulated to be sold, so far as the same should be found just and valid on an examination thereof, to be made by the agent of the tribe and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, subject to the approval of the national council of the Osage nation in each individual case, and of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the amount so allowed and paid should not exceed forty thousand dollars: And provided further, That if the amount of just claims should exceed the sum of forty thousand dollars, the said amount of forty thousand dollars should be divided pro rata among the different claimants whose claims should have been established and allowed. Agreeing, also, that if any individual belonging to said tribe of Indians, or legally incorporated with them, being the head of a family, should desire to commence farming, he should have the privilege to select, in the presence and with the assistance of the agent then in charge, a tract of land within said reservation, not exceeding three hundred and twenty acres in extent, which tract, when selected, certified, and recorded in the land-book, as therein directed, should cease to be held in common; but the same might be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they might continue to cultivate it.

For each tract of land so selected, a certificate, containing a description thereof, and the name of the person selecting it, with a certificate indorsed thereon that the same bad been recorded, should be delivered to the party entitled to it by the agent, after the same should have been recorded by him in a book, to be kept in his office, subject to inspection, which said book should be known as the ''Osage land book.'' And that the President might at any time order a survey of the reservation, and when so surveyed Congress might provide for protecting the rights of said settlers in their improvements, and might fix the title held by each.

Whereas the Great and Little Osage Indians did, on the twenty-seventh day of May, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, in a treaty negotiated and signed on said day by the chiefs, councilmen, and headmen, agree to sell all their lands situated in the State of Kansas, including their trust lands, as well as their diminished reservation, for the sum of one million six hundred thousand dollars, to be held in trust by the government of the United States, and bear interest at the rate of five per centrum per annum, payable semi-annually as follows, to-wit: The interest on one hundred thousand dollars to be paid for the support of schools in said nation; the interest on three hundred thousand dollars to be paid in cash for national purposes, five thousand two hundred dollars thereof to be paid as compensation to the chiefs and councillors of the nation; five thousand to be expended for the encouragement of agriculture, to be paid pro rata to each head of a family in proportion to the number of acres cultivated and improvements made thereon by individual members of the tribe, the object being to encourage real industry among them; the remaining four thousand eight hundred dollars to be expended under the direction of the council and agent for the tribe in the payment of such other expenses as may be necessary for the benefit and support of their national government; and the interest on the balance to be paid to the members of the nation per capita, or to the council for distribution in money, goods, provisions, and other articles of necessity, as the council of the nation and the agent of the tribe may recommend, under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. With the condition, that as a compensation to the Osages, for the stock and farming utensils which the United States agreed to furnish them by the second article of the treaty of January eleventh, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, and which were only in part furnished, the United States should pay the said nation twenty thousand dollars; and as compensation for the saw and grist mills which the United States agreed by said treaty to maintain for them for fifteen years, and which were only maintained five years, the United States should pay said nation ten thousand dollars; which sums should be expended under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the following manner: Twelve thousand dollars in erecting agency buildings, a warehouse, and blacksmith's dwellings, and a blacksmith's shop, and the remaining eighteen thousand dollars in the erection of a school-house and church, and the purchase of a saw and grist mill. Agreeing also, that all debts owing by the Great and Little Osage nation of Indians, and unpaid at the date of the signing of said treaty, either to whites or Indians, by said Osages, should be liquidated and paid out of the funds arising from the sale of the lands stipulated to be sold, so far as the same should be found just and valid on an examination thereof, to be made by the agent of the tribe and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, subject to the approval of the national council of the Osage nation in each individual case, and of the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That the amount so allowed and paid should not exceed forty thousand dollars: And provided further, That if the amount of just claims should exceed the sum of forty thousand dollars, the said amount of forty thousand dollars should be divided pro rata among the different claimants whose claims should have been established and allowed. Agreeing, also, that if any individual belonging to said tribe of Indians, or legally incorporated with them, being the head of a family, should desire to commence farming, he should have the privilege to select, in the presence and with the assistance of the agent then in charge, a tract of land within said reservation, not exceeding three hundred and twenty acres in extent, which tract, when selected, certified, and recorded in the land-book, as therein directed, should cease to be held in common; but the same might be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they might continue to cultivate it. That any person over eighteen years of age, not being the head of a family, might, in like manner, select, and cause to certify to him or her, for purposes of cultivation, a quantity of land, not exceeding eighty acres in extent, and thereupon be entitled to the exclusive possession of the same, as above directed. For each tract of land so selected, a certificate, containing a description thereof, and the name of the person selecting it, with a certificate indorsed thereon that the same had been recorded, should be delivered to the party entitled to it by the agent after the same should have been recorded by him in a book, to be kept in his office, subject to inspection, which said book should be known as the ''Osage land book.'' And that the President might at any time order a survey of the reservation, and when so surveyed Congress might provide for protecting the rights of said settlers in their improvements, and might fix the title held by each. And that the United States might pass such laws on the subject of alienation and descent of property, and on all subjects connected with the government of the Indians on said reservation and the internal police thereof, as might be thought proper: Therefore,",

    "description": "Mr. Harlan asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, and ordered to be printed. A Bill To provide for the sale of the diminished reserve and trust lands of the Kansas or Kaw tribe of Indians in the State of Kansas, and for the settlement of said Indians in the Indian Territory. Whereas the Kansas or Kaw tribe of Indians did on the thirteenth day of March, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, in a treaty negotiated by their chiefs, councilmen, and headmen, agree to sell all their lands situated in the State of Kansas, including the lands unsold, held in trust for them under the fourth article of the treaty of November seventeen, eighteen hundred and sixty, (being about one hundred and thirty-five thousand acres,) at the price of eighty-seven and a half cents per acre; as well as their diminished reserve more particularly described by the survey and plats on file in the Department of the Interior, being a tract about fourteen miles in length from east to west, and about nine miles in width from north to south, and containing about eighty thousand acres, for the sum of one hundred and twenty thousand dollars, payable as follows: Sixty-five thousand dollars within sixty days after the promulgation of the treaty, and the balance in four equal annual payments, with interest payable annually on the whole sum unpaid at the rate of five per centum per annum, with the condition that the United States should give to the said Indians for their future home a tract of land in the Indian country south of Kansas not exceeding twenty miles square. Said reservation to be surveyed under the direction of the Commissioner of the general Land Office, at the expense of the United States; and that as soon as practicable after the selection of the new reservation therein provided for, there should be erected upon such reservation, at the cost of the United States, a dwelling house for the agent of the tribe, a house and shop for a blacksmith, and dwelling-house for a physician, the aggregate cost of which should not exceed the sum of eight thousand dollars; and as soon after such selection of a reservation as might, in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, be deemed advisable for the Indians to remove thereto, (regard being had to the proper season of the year for such removal,) notice should be given to their agent directing such removal; and the expense of such removal, together with the cost of subsistence of said Indians for the term of one year after such removal, should be paid from the proceeds of the sale of their diminished reservation herein authorized to be sold; and that in order to promote the civilization of the tribe, one section of land, convenient to the residence of the agent, should be selected by the agent of said tribe with the approval of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and set apart for a manual labor school, and at any time hereafter, when the Kansas Indians should desire it, an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars might be taken from their funds in the hands of the government for the erection of a school building and the opening of a farm to be attached thereto. The United States agreeing to furnish the said Indians with a physician and necessary medicines, at a cost of not exceeding one thousand five hundred dollars per annum, and a blacksmith at a cost of not exceeding twelve hundred dollars per annum. Agreeing also that the sum of eighteen thousand five hundred and twenty dollars and ninety-three cents, with interest thereon from the first day of January, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, at five per centum, down to the date of the ratification of this treaty, should be appropriated and placed to the credit of the Kansas tribe of Indians to be expended in their behalf under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in establishing them in their new homes, and in the purchase of stock, implements of agriculture, and other articles necessary for their comfort and improvement, which said sum should be received as full compensation for certain money and property belonging to said Indians, appropriated to their own use by their agents, M. C. Dickey and J. Montgomery. Agreeing also, that as the Kansas tribe of Indians were desirous of changing their present mode of life and engaging in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, after removing to their new home, the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, now invested on their account as provided in the second article of the treaty of January fourteen, eighteen hundred and forty-six, together with any other funds accruing to said Indians under the provisions of this treaty, and not otherwise disposed of, should be expended for said Indians by their agent or superintendent, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as follows, viz: Fifty thousand dollars within three months after their removal to their new home, and twenty thousand dollars annually thereafter until the whole shall be expended in the purchase of horses, cattle, agricultural implements, seeds, and such other articles as may tend to advance their civilization. Agreeing also that an investigation should be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as soon as practicable, as to claims of the tribe for alleged losses and damages sustained by them by the unlawful destruction of their timber and other property by whites, and by the stealing of their horses and other stock; and the United States being bound by treaty stipulations to protect, the Indians from such losses, it was agreed that such a mount as might be found due upon such examination should be reported to Congress, and such amount, not exceeding the sum of twenty thousand dollars,should be paid to the said Indians, or expended for their benefit: Provided, That the amount awarded for losses of stock should be paid to the owners of the stock, if they could be found, otherwise to be paid as hereinbefore provided. And an investigation should be made of the books of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and if any amount was found due and unpaid under former treaties, the same should be added to the invested fund of the tribe and five per centum interest paid thereon. Agreeing, also, that the Kansas tribe of Indians, having, between the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, and the fifteenth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, incurred debts amounting to about twelve thousand dollars for outfitting for their hunt, clothing, provisions, and so forth, and since the fifteenth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, having been compelled to incur debts amounting to twenty-eight thousand dollars for subsistence in consequence of the officers of the army and of the Interior Department having expressly prohibited their going upon their annual hunt during that year, therefore it was agreed that an examination of all such debts which might be unpaid at the ratification of said treaty should be made by the agent of said Indians and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, who should report thereon to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and upon the approval of such report by the Secretary of the Interior, the debts recommended therein for payment should be paid by him out of the first money received from the sale of lands under the provisions of said treaty: Provided, however, That the total amount paid in liquidation of such debts should not exceed forty thousand dollars. And in case no provision was made for subsisting said Kansas Indians by the United States between the date of the ratification of said treaty and the date of their removal to their new home, then the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to provide and pay for their subsistence out of any moneys held or received by him for said tribe: Therefore,",

Whereas in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four the United States ordered a survey of the eastern boundary of the Choctaw country under the second article of the treaty of eighteen hundred and twenty, which the Choctaws protested against at the time, as a map of the country plainly shows that said line had not been correctly run; and whereas by the first article of the treaty between the United States and the Choctaws, concluded at the city of Washington in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five, the eastern boundary of the Choctaw country was declared to be ''a line beginning on the Arkansas, one hundred paces east of Old Fort Smith, and running thence due south to Red River, it being understood that this line shall constitute and remain the permanent boundary between the United States and the Choctaws; and the United States agreeing to remove such citizens as may be settled on the west side, to the east side of said line, and to prevent future settlements from being made on the west thereof;'' and whereas the said stipulations of said treaty have never been carried out, although reaffirmed by every treaty made since that time, and the said line so surveyed in eighteen hundred and twenty-four, never have been contemplated by the treaty of eighteen hundred and twenty-five, is not the true boundary line as agreed on by the terms of said treaty, but diverges to the west of the true line, and takes from the Choctaws and Chickasaws a considerable amount of land to which they are justly entitled, as is fully shown by the communication of the Secretary of the Interior to the Honorable Schuyler Colfax, Speaker of the House of Representatives, dated January twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, in which he advises that the lands be given up to the true line, or that compensation be made therefor; and whereas the General Land Office of the United States took possession of said lands, extending up to the line so surveyed in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-four, and had them included in the government surveys of the public land, and sold them to settlers who have since cultivated and improved them: Now, therefore,",
