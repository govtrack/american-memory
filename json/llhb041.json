M. Hutchings and J. C. Lamon had in good faith settled in said valley, with the intention of claiming one hundred and sixty acres each of the public domain under the pre-emption laws of the United States, as soon as said lands should be subject to entry, and they being the only settlers therein; and whereas the said Hutchings and Lamon have resided on and been in possession of the lands thus claimed by them, and have made permanent and substantial improvements thereon to the great convenience and comfort of visitors to said valley, without which the same would be a remote and solitary wilderness; and whereas the said Hutchings and Lamon would unquestionably have been entitled to their pre-emption claims in said valley had the land remained public domain, and the State having succeeded to the rights of the federal government, by gift, in the said valley, cannot afford to be less generous; and whereas it would be improper for the State to erect and keep hotels or other stopping-places in said valley, and a ten years' lease, as contemplated in the act of cession, is wholly inadequate to induce private capital to do so; and whereas, in view of the premises, and as an act of simple justice to the said Hutchings and Lamon, the legislature of the State of California did, by an act which became a law February twentieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, grant to the parties aforesaid the same land they would have been entitled to under the general pre-emption laws, to wit: one hundred and sixty acres each; which act was to take effect and be in force from and after its ratification by the Congress of the United States: Therefore,",

Moore, on leave, introduced the following bill: A Bill To authorize the payment of bounty to certain volunteer officers of the army who served in the late war for the suppression of the rebellion. Whereas many soldiers who enlisted into the service of the United States, as privates, to serve three years or during the war for the suppression of the late rebellion, were mustered out to receive appointment as commissioned officers, thereby forfeiting their claim to bounty, and whereas in many instances such soldiers received pay but a short time as officers, having been discharged on account of wounds received in action, and having actually, in some cases, realized less compensation from the government than they would have received had they continued to serve as privates, or non-commissioned officers; and whereas, many of these brave and gallant defenders of their country are, at this day, in consequence of wounds received in the line of duty, rendered incapable of support and almost wholly dependent upon the small pension they receive from government for their maintenance and the maintenance of their families: Therefore,",

Thomasson, commissioner appointed by the War Department to investigate and report as to the value of the property destroyed, and as to the loyalty of the claimants, and so forth: Therefore,",

    "description": "Read twice and referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. An Act For the relief of Malinda Harmon, widow of Jacob Harmon deceased, of Greene County, Tennessee. Whereas in the fall of eighteen hundred and sixty-one it was decided by the Secretary of War to cause to be destroyed all the railroad bridges in East Tennessee, between Chattanooga and Bristol, and accordingly men were sent there to enlist parties to perform said work; and whereas one Captain David Fry did recruit and enlist as a portion of the force one Jacob Harmon and his two sons; he, Fry, administered the oath to said Harmon and sons; there being no Bible at hand, he caused them to place their hands on the Union flag while he solemnly administered the oath to be ever faithful and true to the Union. He then ordered them to destroy the bridge across Lick Creek, and the trestle-work, near one mile in length, in Greene County, East Tennessee. They soon picked their opportunity, and under the eye of Captain Fry, put fire to the bridge and trestle-work, and destroyed the same; and whereas the said Harmon and two sons were arrested, placed in a rebel prison, were tried by a rebel court-martial, convicted, and Harmon and one son hung till dead, near the town of Knoxville, East Tennessee, on the seventeenth of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, (the other son, having contracted disease while in prison, died); and whereas the said Harmon did employ counsel to defend himself and sons, for which he executed his notes to said attorneys, for the sum of three thousand dollars, and did give said parties a lien or mortgage upon his real estate to secure the same; and whereas on the twenty-seventh day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, a decree of sale of said land was ordered, for the sum of four thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and fifty cents, which, if no relief is given, will leave the widow with five children and but little means left whereby to make a support; and whereas it is evident that said Harmon and sons lost their lives in the service of the government, and now, in the name of justice, honor, and humanity the Congress of the United States is in duty bound to relieve the widow and her children from this debt of oppression, they never having received one cent for the services rendered by her said husband: Therefore,",

Butler from the Committee on Reconstruction, to the bill (H.R. 3011) to protect loyal and peaceable citizens of the United States in the full enjoyment of their rights, persons, liberty, and property, and to enable such citizens to preserve and perpetuate the evidence of losses claimed to have been sustained by them in the war in the States lately in rebellion. Whereas large numbers of lawless and evil-disposed persons, especially in the States lately in rebellion, having conspired together and bound themselves to each other by unlawful oaths, have formed secret organizations, some of which are commonly known as tho Ku-Klux Klan, having for their main object to defeat certain classes of citizens of the United States in the liberty, rights, and equal protection of tho laws guaranteed by the Constitution; and whereas, by the use of disguises worn upon their persons, by perjury, violence, threats, overawing the local authorities, and otherwise, such persons and organizations, their aiders and abettors, have evaded and set at defiance the power of the States wherein they exist, and thus with impunity have deprived, and still do deprive, peaceable citizens of the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property without due process of law, and have taken from them, and do still take from them, the equal protection of the laws, by which means such peaceable citizens have been made to do acts against their will, and forego their just rights and freedom of action, as their only means of escape from death or great bodily harm at the hands of such persons and organizations; and whereas the States have failed and still fail to prevent or suppress such violations of law and denial of the liberty, rights, and protection guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States to persons within their respective jurisdictions; and whereas it has been thus rendered imperative on Congress to enforce all constitutional guarantees by appropriate legislation: Therefore,",
