Mr. Dickinson, of Tennessee, from, the Committee on Indian Affairs, reported the following bill: For the relief of certain Choctaw Indians. Whereas, by the fourteenth article of the treaty between the United States and the Choctaw tribe of Indians, concluded at Dancing Rabbit creek, on the twenty-seventh day of September, eighteen hundred and thirty, it is provided that ''each Choctaw head of a family, being desirous to remain and become a citizen of the States, shall be permitted to do so by signifying his intention to the agent within six months from the ratification of this treaty, and he or she shall thereupon be entitled to a reservation of one section of six hundred and forty acres of land, to be bounded by sectional lines of survey; in like manner shall be entitled to one-half that quantity for each unmarried child which is living with him, over ten years of age; and a quarter section to such child as may be under ten years of age, to adjoin the location of the parent. If they reside upon said lands, intending to become citizens of the United States, for five years after the ratification of this treaty, in that case a grant in fee simple shall issue. Said reservation shall include the present improvement of the head of the family, or a portion of it. Persons who claim under this article shall not lose the privilege of a Choctaw citizen; but if they ever remove, are not to be entitled to any portion of the Choctaw annuity.'' And whereas it is alleged by certain Indian heads of families of the said nation that they did, in pursuance of the provisions of the said treaty, signify to the agent of the United States appointed to receive such declaration, their intention to remain and become citizens of the United States, and that, by the neglect or default of said agent, the evidence of such signification of their intent has been lost or destroyed, by reason whereof they have been deprived of the reservations intended to be secured to them by the said treaty: Therefore,",
