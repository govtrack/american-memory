Whereas our mines of the precious metals are unsurpassed in richness, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people and finally extinguish the public indebtedness; and whereas the silver mines on the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, have proved more productive than any others known to modern times, and are believed to be inexhaustible in wealth, but owing to the great expense of working them are liable to be abandoned by private enterprise; and whereas they can only be saved therefrom by the construction of a deep working and draining tunnel, which shall at once secure the production of many millions of treasure, and prove as a great index work the continuance of mineral lode in depth, and the practical importance of thus working them; and whereas the magnitude of such work is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and if completed will be of vast benefit to the government and the whole people of the United States; and whereas by an act of the legislature of the State of Nevada, approved April four, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, entitled ''An act granting the right of way, and authorizing A. Sutro and his associates to construct a mining an draining tunnel,'' certain exclusive privileges of rights of way for the construction of a tunnel into the Comstock lode, from any point to be selected in the foot-hills of the Carson river valley were granted as by reference to said act will more fully appear; and whereas an act of Congress was approved the twenty-fifth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, entitled ''An act granting to A. Sutro the right of way and granting other privileges to aid in the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode in the State of Nevada,'' in and by which the right of way and certain other privileges were granted to the said A. Sutro, his heirs and assigns, for the purpose of driving a tunnel from some point to be selected by the grantee at the hills near Carson river, within Lyon county, to and beyond the Comstock lode, as by reference to said act of Congress will more fully appear; and whereas it is the purpose and intention of the said A. Sutro and his associates to acquire a charter of incorporation under the laws of the States of New York, California, and Nevada, or of one or more of said States, and to assign, transfer, and set over to said corporation, all and singular, the rights, privileges, and immunities of them the said A. Sutro and associates now possessed, under the aforesaid legislation, or which may be conferred by the present act of Congress, as soon as said corporation shall be fully organized: Therefore,",

Sutro and his associates to acquire a charter of incorporation under the laws of the States of New York, California, and Nevada, or of one or more of said States, and to assign, transfer, and set over to said corporation, all and singular, the rights, privileges, and immunities of them, the said Adolph Sutro and associates, now possessed, under the aforesaid legislation, or which may be conferred by the present act of Congress, as soon as said corporation shall be fully organized: Therefore,",

Cox. Whereas W. H. Cox, a hale, hearty, young man of about twenty years of age, residing with his father Charles D. Cox, of Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and being a part of his family, on the sixteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, was enrolled as a sergeant in company F, second regiment Pennsylvania artillery, to serve three years or during the war; that he was regularly mustered in as such, and at the battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia, on or about the second of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, was taken prisoner by the rebels and sent to Andersonville, Georgia, and there confined as a prisoner of war for the period of ten months, and from exposure and lack of food became very much debilitated, and after being released he was on the eighth of August eighteen hundred and sixty-five, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by virtue of a telegram dated Adjutant General's office, May twelfth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, honorably discharged from the United States service; and whereas the said W.

Cox, father of said deceased soldier is desirous of obtaining the pension justly due his said son from date of his discharge till death, to be applied to the purchase of a suitable monument to be placed at his grave: Therefore,",
