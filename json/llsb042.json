    "description": "Mr. Pratt asked and, by unanimous consent, obtained leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, referred to the Committee on Claims. and ordered to be printed. A Bill For the relief of those suffering from the destruction of the salt works near Manchester, Kentucky, pursuant to the orders of Major General Carlos Buell. Whereas, on the sixteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, the Adjutant General, by order of the Secretary of War, made the following order: \"Ordered, That William P. Thomasson, esquire, of Louisville, Kentucky, be, and he is hereby, authorized to investigate and report to this Department, the value of the Goose Creek Salt Mills, destroyed by the order of Major General Buell, in Kentucky; that he give notice to the proprietors or their agents of the time and place at which he will receive testimony; and that he take such further testimony on the part of the Government as may be necessary to protect the rights and interests of the Government, as well upon the point of value as of the loyalty of the proprietors to the Government of the United States.\" And whereas the said commissioner, on the thirteenth day of May following, submitted his report to the Secretary of War, in which he estimated the injuries done to the several salt wells, their pumps and pipes, the deterioration to the furnaces and fixtures, and the value of the salt and salt barrels destroyed and in which, also, he estimated and allowed such sums as would have been realized from the production of salt, but for such destruction, for the period of eight months succeeding the date of destruction. And whereas he classified in his schedule his allowances, as follows, to wit:--Case number one: The United States to T. T. Garrard, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for one hundred and twenty four salt barrels, at forty cents each, forty-nine dollars and sixty cents; for six thousand three hundred bushels of salt destroyed, at fifty cents per bushel, three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars; for deterioration of furnace and fixtures by non-usage, five hundred dollars; for nine thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, at fifty cents, nine thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of thirteen thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine dollars and sixty cents. Case number two: The United States to James W. Reid, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for five thousand bushels salt destroyed, two thousand five hundred dollars; for deterioration of furnaces and fixtures, five hundred dollars; for eleven thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, five thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of nine thousand one hundred dollars. Case number three: The United States to White, Horton and Garrard, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for two thousand bushels of salt destroyed, one thousand dollars; for deterioration of furnace and fixtures by non-usage, five hundred and fifty dollars; for sixteen thousand bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, eight thousand dollars, making a total of ten thousand and fifty dollars. Case number four: The United States to Gilson and Chastam, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for eight thousand bushels salt destroyed, four thousand dollars; for deterioration by non-usage of furnace and fixtures, five hundred dollars; for nine thousand six hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, four thousand eight hundred dollars, making a total of nine thousand eight hundred dollars. Case number five: The United States to I. and D. White, debtor, for injury to wells, pumps, pipes, and so forth, one thousand dollars; for injury to water-pipe, furnace, and so forth, one thousand dollars; for nine thousand bushels salt destroyed, at fifty cents per bushel, four thousand five hundred dollars; for deterioration by non-usage to furnace and fixtures, five hundred and fifty dollars; for twenty thousand bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, ten thousand dollars, making a total of seventeen thousand and fifty dollars. Case number six: The United States to I. and D. White, survivors, for injury to well, pump, and pipe, five hundred dollars. And whereas said report, under a call of the House of Representatives at the first session of the Thirty-eighth Congress, was furnished by the Secretary of War and printed as Executive Document twenty-nine. And whereas said report of the commissioner has never been acted upon, and the said parties, in favor of whom said allowances were made, were in some cases proprietors and in others lessees, and changes by death, assignment, or otherwise may have occurred during the time which has elapsed since said report was made, and it is desirable that the parties entitled to the sums hereinafter named on account of the injuries and losses aforesaid should be paid: Now, therefore,",

Elston, on the twenty-fifth day of June, eighteen hundred and thirty-five, agreed to donate to the United States a piece or parcel of ground in Michigan City, in the State of Indiana, for a light-house, said piece or parcel of land to be two hundred and sixty feet long and one hundred and seventy-five feet wide, the courses of the lines to run parallel to the streets in said city. That on that day the said Elston, intending to convey the land so donated, executed a deed to the United States for a piece or parcel of ground, and by mistake described it as follows: \"All that tract or parcel of land situate, lying, and being in the county of Laporte, in the State of Indiana, and in and part of section twenty-nine in township thirty-eight north, range four west, bounded as follows, namely: beginning at a point twenty feet west of a stake stuck for the site of a light-house, and from thence south one hundred and thirty feet to a stake, and from thence east one hundred and seventy-five feet to a stake, and from thence north to Lake Michigan two hundred and sixty feet; thence west with the margin of the lake one hundred and seventy-five feet, and from thence south to the place of beginning.\" That the United States soon after the execution of said deed took possession of the ground first above described and so intended to be conveyed, and built a light-house thereon, inclosed it with a fence, and thence hitherto have held the exclusive possession thereof, and have never asserted title to any other property under said deed; and Whereas the said Elston was the owner of all the land adjoining said ground and retained possession thereof, and afterward sold and conveyed the same to innocent purchasers, who, or those claiming under such conveyances, caused the same to be platted and laid out into town lots as an addition to Michgan City, and which said town lots were laid out with reference to the land so taken possession of and fenced by the United States, and which said land and town lots are now held and possessed in good faith by the remote vendees of said Elston: Now therefore, For the purpose of correcting said mistake and releasing all right, title, or interest which the United States may have by virtue of the error in said deed of said Elston: Therefore,",

Whereas in the third article of the treaty made and concluded on the twenty-eighth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, between the United States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations of Indians, it is provided that the sum of three hundred thousand dollars (the consideration for the cession of certain territory by said nations to the United States) shall be invested and held by the United States, at an interest of not less than five per centum, in trust for the said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, to be paid to the same in the proportion of three-fourths to the former and one-fourth to the latter immediately upon the enactment of such laws, rules, and regulations by their respective legislatures as may be necessary to give all persons of African descent, resident in said nations at the date of the treaty of Fort Smith, and their descendants, previously held in slavery among said nations, all the rights, privileges, and immunities, including the right of suffrage, of citizens of said nations; and on failure to pass such laws, rules, and regulations by the legislatures of said nations, respectively, within two years from the ratification of said treaty, the said sum of three hundred thousand dollars shall cease to be held in trust for the said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations, and shall be held for the use and benefit of such of said persons of African descent as the United States shall remove from said Territory, in such manner as the United States shall deem proper, the United States agreeing, within ninety days from the expiration of said treaty, to remove from said nations, all such persons of African descent as may be willing to remove; and Whereas, further, the said Choctaw and Chickasaw legislatures have heretofore refused, and still refuse, to pass such laws, rules, and regulations as aforesaid, but have respectively passed enactments declaring it to be the unanimous consent of said legislatures that the United States shall hold said three hundred thousand dollars for the benefit of said freedmen, and directing notice to be given to the United States that it is their wish that said persons of African descent be removed by the United States beyond the limits of said Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations respectively, according to the provisions of article three of the treaty aforesaid; and it being the desire of said freedmen to remove beyond the limits of said nations, and to receive the said sum of three hundred thousand dollars: Therefore,",

Wilson recovered final judgment in said suit against the Bank of Louisiana, on the twelfth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, for the sum of one hundred and six thousand nine hundred and sixty-nine dollars, by virtue of which judgment said Wilson is lawfully entitled to the money so realized on said cotton, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of forty-two thousand four hundred and fifty dollars and seventy-five cents; and Whereas no part of said moneys so deposited by said clerk and marshal was ever withdrawn from said bank; and Whereas after said deposits said bank became insolvent, and a decree of the dissolution thereof was entered in the district court of the United States for the middle district of Alabama; and Whereas the assets of said bank came into the hands of Cornelius Cadle, junior, by virtue of an appointment to receive the same, issued by the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States, and from time to time the said Cadle has paid over to the Treasurer of the United States the moneys received by him: Therefore,",

Whereas agents of the Government of the United States seized seven hundred and fifty-eight hales of cotton at Shreveport, in the State of Louisiana, on the first day of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, the property of Henry Ware, then of Harrison County, Texas, now of Louisiana, on the false pretext that fifty-five bales thereof had been the property of the late confederate government, and under certain proceedings instituted in the State court for the recovery of said cotton by the owner thereof, the sheriff took possession of the same and was immediately thereafter forcibly dispossessed by United States troops, by order of the commander of the post of Shreveport; and said agents sent said cotton to New Orleans where it was held by the United States until the sixth day of March, eighteen hundred and sixty-six; and Whereas while said cotton was so held by the United States, at New Orleans, the owner thereof twice petitioned the department commander, Major General E. R. L. Canby, for permission to institute an action in the United States district court for the recovery thereof, and was refused, and was assured by said department commander that the possession of said cotton would be forcibly maintained; and Whereas when the United States returned said cotton to its lawful owner, said Henry Ware, it was deficient in quantity and inferior in quality, and was worth fifty-three thousand nine hundred and seventy-one dollars and sixty-one cents less than when so seized, and the United States compelled said Ware to pay excessive and unlawful charges on said cotton, amounting to ten thousand eight hundred and forty-two dollars and thirty-one cents, as the condition of the restoratian thereof; and Whereas the owner of said cotton having, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, instituted an action for the recovery of the difference in the value of the same at the time of the seizure and the time of the restoration thereof, and also of said excessive charges, against the agents of the United States, in a State court of Louisiana, the said department commander, on the twenty-fourth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, issued his order prohibiting said court from entertaining jurisdiction of said action, but afterward, on the fourteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized said court to entertain such jurisdiction, and the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States employed attorneys and counsel who defended said action, and judgment therein was rendered for said Ware for the difference in the value of said cotton when seized and when restored, and for the charges so paid, amounting in the aggregate to sixty-four thousand eight hundred and thirteen dollars and ninety-two cents, with interest and costs, and no part of said judgment has ever been paid: Therefore,",

Whereas the International Steamship Company have made to the Navy Department the following proposals to create iron-ship building yards and docks, by which iron naval and commercial steamers can be built as cheaply in the United States as in Europe; and to establish semi-weekly transatlantic steamers without other subsidy than the postages arising from mail-matter, as now authorized by law: And whereas the Western Iron-Ship and Boat-Building Company have proposed to erect an iron-ship and boat-building yard on the Mississippi River, or one of its tributaries, on the same plans, terms, and conditions as those of the International Steamship Company; said proposals are set forth in Senate Miscellaneous Document Number One hundred and forty-three, of present session: Now, therefore, to secure the positive construction of said yards to aid American commerce, and to afford greater facilities for the construction and repair of naval ships and machinery:",

Whereas our public lands contain mines of the precious metals which are unsurpassed in extent, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people; and Whereas a wise policy indicates that the revenue derived from our mineral lands should, to some extent, be devoted again to the much-needed development of that important interest; and Whereas Congress, by an act approved July twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro certain rights and privileges, which have been assigned, transferred, and set over to a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of California, and known as the Sutro Tunnel Company; and Whereas great benefits will accrue to the people of the United States from the construction of said tunnel, which, as a great geological survey, penetrating into an argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than has yet been reached by any similar work in the world, will establish the value of our mineral domain; and Whereas the principal wealth of our mineral regions consists in low-grade ores, which can only be utilized by means of improved reduction, concentration, and smelting works, for the erection of which extraordinary facilities exist at the mouth of said tunnel; and Whereas this work bears a national character, and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and the security offered to the Government is ample for the repayment of any sums to be advanced under this act: Therefore,",

    "description": "Mr. Nye asked and, by unanimous consent, obtained leave to bring in the following bill; which was read twice, referred to the Committee on Mines and Mining, and ordered to be printed. Reported by Mr. Alcorn with amendments, viz: Insert the parts printed in italics. A Bill To aid in the construction of the Sutro tunnel from the proceeds of the sale of mineral lands. Whereas our public lands contain mines of the precious metals which are unsurpassed in extent, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people; and Whereas a wise policy indicates that the revenue derived from our mineral lands should, to some extent, be devoted again to the much-needed development of that important interest; and Whereas Congress, by an act approved July twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro certain rights and privileges, which have been assigned, transferred, and set over to a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of California, and known as the Sutro Tunnel Company; and Whereas great benefits will accrue to the people of the United States from the construction of said tunnel, which, as a great geological survey, penetrating into an argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than has yet been reached by any similar work in the world, will establish the value of our mineral domain; and Whereas the principal wealth of our mineral regions, consists in low-grade ores, which can only be utilized by means of improved reduction, concentration, and smelting works, for the erection of which extraordinary facilities exist at the month of said tunnel; and Whereas this work bears a national character, and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and the security offered to the Government is ample for the repayment of any sums to be advanced under this act: Therefore,",

A Bill For the relief of Amanda M. Smyth, widow of the late Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth. Whereas Thomas A. Smyth, of the city of Wilmington, Delaware, on the breaking out of the rebellion in eighteen hundred and sixty-one, raised a company of men and tendered them for three months' service to the United States, in answer to the call of President Lincoln for seventy-five thousand volunteers; after serving three months, he returned to Wilmington, Delaware, with his company, and was mustered into the volunteer service of the United States as major of the First Delaware Regiment; soon afterward the First Delaware left for the seat of war, and Major Thomas A. Smyth, who was with the regiment in all its memorable engagements, was promoted for gallant and meritorious conduct on the battle-field, as follows: To lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two; to colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three; to brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and to brevet major-general, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and died at Burkesville, Virginia, on the ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, from wounds received at the battle of Farmville, Virginia, two days previous; and Whereas the said Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth was actively engaged in the military service of the Republic during the whole of the late civil war, until he fell at the head of his column mortally wounded, leading the advance of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the very last charge, and in the last great fight of the seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, previous to the surrender of the rebel General R. E. Lee; and Whereas the said General Thomas A. Smyth, while commissioned as major from October seventeenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, to December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, performed the duties of colonel and had command of the regiment; and when commissioned lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, and as brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, until the day of his death-wound, had assigned to him the command of brigades and divisions, and by alternates performed the duties of brigadier and major general; while acting as colonel he received only the pay of major, and while acting as brigadier and major general, only the pay of lieutenant-colonel and colonel; and Whereas the widow and child of the said late General Thomas A. Smyth are justly entitled, not as a matter of favor, but as a matter of right, to back pay for actual services rendered by him on the field, and which he would have received had he been commissioned according to his respective commands, or in accordance with the repeated wishes and earnest recommendations of his corps commanders: Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises,",

Whereas the Congress of the United States of America, on the eleventh day of August, eighteen hundred and fifty-six, granted certain lands to the State of Mississippi to aid in the construction of a railroad from Brandon, in said State, to the Gulf of Mexico; and whereas those lands reverted to the United States by reason of the failure to build said road within the time prescribed by the terms of the act making that grant: Therefore,",

A Bill Granting the right of way to the Elyton, Corinth and Tennessee River Railroad Company through the public domain, and for other purposes. Whereas Northwestern Alabama contains a large amount of wild and unsalable lands which have remained on the hands of the Government for many years; and Whereas these lands are remotely situated from navigable rivers and railroads, among rugged mountains and difficult of access, and but poorly adapted to agricultural pursuits; and Whereas the inhabitants of this region of country have no means for the transportation of the fruits of their labor to and from the usual market, except by the common wagon over rough roads, at a great expense of personal exposure, time, and labor; and Whereas, for the causes above enumerated, this region must ever remain sparsely settled and undeveloped until brought under the influence of the only adequate means yet found for the development and utilization of such countries--the railroad; and Whereas this region covers an area equivalent to one hundred miles square, or ten thousand square miles, which must be traversed by the Elyton, Corinth and Tennessee Railroad diagonally, from the southeast to the northwest, for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles in the State of Alabama, and which presents no means whatever of adequate local contributions to the cost of constructing said road; and Whereas the said railroad is deemed of national importance by the great communities of the Northwestern and Southwestern States of the Union, connecting, as it does, the great railway system of the South, concentering at Birmingham, Alabama, from all the ports of the South Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, with the navigable waters and railway system of the great Northwest, thus bringing these two great communities of the nation into direct, cheap, and easy communication, by which they can exchange the commodities of their respective countries with great reciprocal advantages; and Whereas the said railroad will, by developing the natural resources of the country through which it runs, greatly enhance the national and State revenues, while it subserves the wants of the people as a desideratum to their progress, prosperity and happiness; and Whereas for the reasons above enumerated the said railroad cannot be constructed without some special basis for its financiering by which large amounts of cash capital can be attracted from other communities to aid in its creation, and which must remain unproductive for a number of years, as is usual in such cases; Therefore",

Thomas, twentieth district; M. H. Twitchell, twenty-second district, were elected senators for the term of four years, a term not yet expired; and that the said two enumerated classes of senators united make a number greater than a quorum if the Senate were full; that by said election-returns it appears that the following persons, namely, P. Landry and C. N. Lewis, of the parish of Ascension; J. J. Mellon and James Timony, of the first ward of the parish of Orleans; J. A. Shakespeare, J. A. Rice, and J. J. Finney, of the second ward of the parish of Orleans; E. H. McCaleb and Charles Montaldo, of the third ward of the parish of Orleans; T. B. Blanchard, of the fourth ward of the parish of Orleans; V.
