    "description": "Mr. Pratt, from the Committee on Claims, submitted a report, (No. 365,) accompanied by the following joint resolution; which was read and passed to a second reading. Joint Resolution For the relief of those suffering from the destruction of the salt works near Manchester, Kentucky, pursuant to the orders of Major General Carols Buell. Whereas, on the sixteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, the Adjutant General, by order of the Secretary of War, made the following order: ''Ordered, That William P. Thomasson, esquire, of Louisville, Kentucky, be, and he is hereby, authorized to investigate and report to this Department, the value of the Goose Creek Salt Mills, destroyed by the order of Major General Buell, in Kentucky; that he give notice to the proprietors or their agents of the time and place at which he will receive testimony; and that he take such further testimony on the part of the Government as may be necessary to protect the rights and interests of the Government, as well upon the point of value as of the loyalty of the proprietors to the Government of the United States.'' And whereas the said commissioner, on the thirteenth day of May following, submitted his report to the Secretary of War, in which he estimated the injuries done to the several salt wells, their pumps and pipes, the deterioration to the furnaces and fixtures, and the value of the salt and salt barrels destroyed and in which, also, he estimated and allowed such sums as would have been realized from the production of salt, but for such destruction, for the period of eight months succeeding the date of destruction. And whereas he classified in his schedule his allowances, as follows, to wit:--Case number one: The United States to T. T. Garrard, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for one hundred and twenty-four salt barrels, at forty cents each, forty-nine dollars and sixty cents; for six thousand three hundred bushels of salt destroyed, at fifty cents per bushel, three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars; for deterioration of furnace and fixtures by non-usage, five hundred dollars; for nine thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, at fifty cents, nine thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of thirteen thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine dollars and sixty cents. Case number two: The United States to James W. Reid, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for five thousand bushels salt destroyed, two thousand five hundred dollars; for deterioration of furnaces and fixtures, five hundred dollars; for eleven thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, five thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of nine thousand one hundred dollars. Case number three: The United States to White, Horton and Garrard, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for two thousand bushels of salt destroyed, one thousand dollars; for deterioration of furnace and fixtures by non-usage, five hundred and fifty dollars; for sixteen thousand bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, eight thousand dollars, making a total of ten thousand and fifty dollars. Case number four: The United States to Gilson and Chastam, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for eight thousand bushels salt destroyed, four thousand dollars; for deterioration by non-usage of furnace and fixtures, five hundred dollars; for nine thousand six hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, four thousand eight hundred dollars, making a total of nine thousand eight hundred dollars. Case number five: The United States to I. and D. White, debtor, for injury to wells, pumps, pipes, and so forth, one thousand dollars; for injury to water-pipe, furnace, and so forth, one thousand dollars; for nine thousand bushels salt destroyed, at fifty cents per bushel, four thousand five hundred dollars; for deterioration by non-usage to furnace and fixtures, five hundred and fifty dollars; for twenty thousand bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, ten thousand dollars, making a total of seventeen thousand and fifty dollars. Case number six: The United States to I. and D. White, survivors, for injury to well, pump, and pipe, five hundred dollars. And whereas said report, under a call of the House of Representatives at the first session of the Thirty-eighth Congress, was furnished by the Secretary of War and printed as Executive document number twenty-nine. And whereas said report of the commissioner has never been acted upon, and the said parties, in favor of whom said allowances were made, were in some cases proprietors and in others lessees, and changes by death, assignment, or otherwise may have occurred during the time which has elapsed since said report was made, and it is desirable that the parties entitled to the sums hereinafter named of account of the injuries and losses aforesaid should be paid: Now, therefore,",
