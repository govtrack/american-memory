Joint Resolution Relative to claims of certain northern creditors, [Whereas the congress of the Confederate States ordered the sequestration and confiscation of all the debts due from inhabitants of the Southern States to their creditors residing in the loyal States; and whereas there was paid to the Citizens' Bank of New Orleans, prior to the first day of May, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, a sum exceeding half a million of dollars, the proceeds of such confiscation of northern credits, of which there remained to the credit of the Confederate States receivers, in such bank, the sum of two hundred and nineteen thousand and ninety dollars and ninety-four cents only, on the first day of May, at the time of the occupation of the city of New Orleans by the forces of the United States, which said sum, by the order of the general then commanding the Department of the Gulf, was seized for the benefit of the northern creditors whose debts had been thus confiscated, and said sum was by him sent to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, to be by him held in trust for the benefit of said northern creditors; and whereas, owing to a doubt entertained by the Secretary of the Treasury as to his legal authority to distribute said sum of two hundred and nineteen thousand and ninety dollars and ninety-four cents among the creditors to whom it belongs, and to determine the rights of each to his portion thereof, the money has lain thus undisturbed in the Treasury since July, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, to the great injury and detriment of the just and lawful owners thereof although they have made many application to have the same:] Whereas the Congress of the Confederate States ordered the sequestration and confiscation of all the debts due and owing, from inhabitants of the Southern States engaged in rebellion, to their creditors residing in the loyal States; and whereas under general order, number forty, issued by Major General Butler, from his headquarters at New Orleans, on June six, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, there was seized in the hands of different banks in said city, as large sums of money, the proceeds of the confiscation of northern credits, deposited in said banks to the credit of the Confederate States receivers, which sum ought to be distributed in ratable proportions among such loyal creditors whose debts were thus confiscated, and who have not been able since the close of the rebellion to collect the same from their debtors; and whereas the Secretary of the Treasury is of the opinion that he has no power to distribute this money among the creditors entitled to the same, and determine the rights of each to his portion thereof without further legislation, and said money has been in the Treasury of the United States since the month of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, to the great injury of the lawful owners thereof, although they have made repeated applications for the same: Now, therefore,",

Joint Resolution For the relief of those suffering from the destruction of the salt works near Manchester, Kentucky, pursuant to the orders of Major General Carols Buell. Whereas, on the sixteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, the Adjutant General, by order of the Secretary of War, made the following order: ''Ordered, That William P. Thomasson, esquire, of Louisville, Kentucky, be, and he is hereby, authorized to investigate and report to this Department, the value of the Goose Creek Salt Mills, destroyed by the order of Major General Buell, in Kentucky; that he give notice to the proprietors or their agents of the time and place at which he will receive testimony; and that he take such further testimony on the part of the Government as may be necessary to protect the rights and interests of the Government, as well upon the point of value as of the loyalty of the proprietors to the Government of the United States.'' And whereas the said commissioner, on the thirteenth day of May following, submitted his report to the Secretary of War, in which he estimated the injuries done to the several salt wells, their pumps and pipes, the deterioration to the furnaces and fixtures, and the value of the salt and salt barrels destroyed and in which, also, he estimated and allowed such sums as would have been realized from the production of salt, but for such destruction, for the period of eight months succeeding the date of destruction. And whereas he classified in his schedule his allowances, as follows, to wit:--Case number one: The United States to T. T. Garrard, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for one hundred and twenty-four salt barrels, at forty cents each, forty-nine dollars and sixty cents; for six thousand three hundred bushels of salt destroyed, at fifty cents per bushel, three thousand one hundred and fifty dollars; for deterioration of furnace and fixtures by non-usage, five hundred dollars; for nine thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, at fifty cents, nine thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of thirteen thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine dollars and sixty cents. Case number two: The United States to James W. Reid, debtor, for injury to well, pump, pipe, and so forth, five hundred dollars; for five thousand bushels salt destroyed, two thousand five hundred dollars; for deterioration of furnaces and fixtures, five hundred dollars; for eleven thousand two hundred bushels salt, the anticipated yield for eight months, five thousand six hundred dollars, making a total of nine thousand one hundred dollars.
