Whereas, in the years eighteen hundred and sixty and eighteen hundred and sixty-one, the inhabitants of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas changed their respective constitutions so as to make them repugnant to the Constitution of the United States; and whereas the inhabitants of these States made war upon the United States, and after many battles finally surrendered, under the rules and usages of war; and whereas the inhabitants of these States, at the time of their surrender, were without legal State governments, and, as a rebel population, were without authority to form legal State governments, or to exercise any other political functions belonging to loyal citizens, and they must so continue until relieved of such disabilities by the law-making power of the United States; and whereas it belongs to Congress, in the discharge of its duties under the Constitution, to secure to each of these States a republican form of government and to provide for the restoration of each to practical relations with the Union; and whereas until these things are done, it is important that provisional governments should be established in these States with legal power to protect good citizens in the enjoyment of their rights and to watch over the formation of State governments so that the same shall be truly loyal and republican: Therefore,",

Whereas, the legislature in the State of Georgia, elected, under its new constitution, preparatory to the restoration of that State to its proper place in the Union and to the admission of senators and representatives in Congress therefrom, has, in violation of the fourteenth, amendment to the Constitution of the United States, refused to purge itself of members who by said amendment were prohibited from being such members and from acting as such, and has permitted and continues to permit such members to act as such; and whereas, a majority of the persons in fact composing said legislature has, in violation of said constitution, and in violation of the fundamental principles upon which Congress consented to the restoration aforesaid, expelled from said legislature a large number of its legally qualified members upon the sole ground that they were persons of African blood; and whereas it appears that the local authorities in said State are wholly unable or unwilling to protect the lives, liberties, and property of lawful and unoffending citizens of said State from lawless violence, and refrain purposely, or from want of power, from bringing such offenders to justice, whereby it fully appears that the people of the State of Georgia have not complied with the terms or conformed to the principles upon which its restoration was provided for, and that the government thereof is not in fact republican or regular: Therefore,",

Whereas it appears that it is the intention of Congress, by the act to which this act is an amendment, to cause to be constructed a railroad from McGregor, on the Mississippi river, in the State of Iowa, thence westerly to the Missouri river, on or near the forty-third parallel of latitude, to a point at or near Yancton, in the Territory of Dakota, a distance of about three hundred and fifty miles; also a railroad from Sioux City, in the State of Iowa, to the Minnesota State line, at a point between the Big Sioux and the west fork of the Des Monies river, there to connect with a railroad running to the head of Lake Superior, via Saint Paul, to the end that the United States may the sooner sell their lands located on the above routes, and that the country around may be the more rapidly settled up and improved, and that the United States government may have and enjoy increased facilities for the transportation of mails, troops, supplies, and munitions of war; and whereas the McGregor Western Railway Company named in said act to which this is an amendment, after building about forty-five miles of said railroad, sold, assigned and transferred the same, and the legislature of Iowa, by an act entitled \"An act to resume all the lands and rights conferred upon the McGregor Western Railway Company, by or under an act of Congress,\" approved may twelfth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, resumed said grant by an act of said State, approved March thirty-first, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, and granted said lands to the McGregor and Sioux City Railway Company, the assignee and the successor of the said McGregor Western Railway Company, which act of the Iowa legislature has been duly accepted by said McGregor and Sioux City Railway Company as therein required: Therefore,",
