Joint Resolution For the appointment of a commission, to consist of engineers of the army, upon the subject of the construction of railroad bridges across the Mississippi river. Whereas the Mississippi river is one of the greatest highways of inland commerce in the world, affording, together with its connecting rivers, many thousands of miles of navigable waters, for the cheap transportation of agricultural, mineral, manufacturing, and other bulky products; and whereas, to insure safety and economy in such transit, the navigation of said stream must be protected from all obstructions, whether natural or artificial, especially as the methods of transfer on barges towed by steamers, and requiring much larger channel-way than heretofore, are now coming into general use on the western rivers; and whereas the necessities of land travel and railway connexion render it very desirable that the proper steps should be taken for bridging said stream at such points as may be found practicable for effecting continuous freight lines from west to east, and under such conditions of structure, as to height, channel-way, position of piers, and plan of operation, whether by draw or otherwise, as will not, by any possibility, operate to render the navigation of said stream dangerous to the lives of passengers or the safety of cargoes; and whereas it is proper that the Congress of the United States should protect the navigation of this highway of inland waters from the obstructions of private persons or interested corporations, and yet should concede such privileges in regard to bridging the same as may not interfere with the rightful claims of river commerce, and in order to do so should be furnished with accurate information on the points stated, to guide its legislation and prevent it from doing any wrong in the premises: Therefore be it",
