Whereas under the laws of the State of California a corporation has been organized, and is now making surveys for the avowed object of diverting and drawing off the waters of Lake Tahoe, so as to supply the city of San Francisco and intermediate places with water for domestic and irrigating purposes, and at charges to be fixed by and paid to said corporation; and Whereas the United States have not parted with their title to said lake, nor to the lands adjoining the same on all sides thereof; and Whereas such diversion of said waters would render valueless and practically prevent the sale or occupation of a large area of public lands, which could be irrigated and rendered arable by the natural flow of the waters from said lake; and Whereas the State of California was, on the ninth day of September, anno Domini eighteen hundred and fifty, admitted into the Union,\" upon the express condition that the people of said State, through their legislature or otherwise, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the public lands within its limits, and shall pass no law and do no act whereby the title of the United States to and right to dispose of the same shall be impaired or questioned;\" and upon the further condition \"that all the navigable waters within the said State shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of said State as to the citizens of the United States, without any tax, impost, or duty therefor:\" Therefore,",

Whereas the President of the United States, by proclamation bearing date May the ninth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, declared the war at an end; and whereas, by proclamation of May the twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, he directed the restoration of all private property, \"except as to slaves;\" and whereas, in obedience to the fifth section of the act of Congress approved July thirteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, and the sixth section of Treasury Regulations approved March thirty-first, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, made in pursuance of said act of Congress, the President, by proclamation of June twenty-fourth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, restored commercial intercourse between all the States of the American Union; and whereas the Secretary of the Treasury, by the authority of the same, issued a circular letter of instructions, of date June twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, withdrawing the authority of the Treasury Department to seize cotton of any character or description after the thirtieth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five; and whereas said circular letter of instructions not only forbid the seizure of all cotton after said date, but simply authorized Treasury agents to receive cotton formerly the property of the Confederate States, which had been theretofore surrendered to the military and naval authorities of the United States; and whereas seizures of such property were made as late as December, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, under the pretext that such cotton was the property of the Confederate States, whereby the pretext of seizure authorized the agent to retain one-fourth of the amount seized; and whereas the owners of the property, at the time of seizure, had renewed their allegiance to the Government of the United States; and whereas many of said claimants for such property are barred by the statute of limitations from obtaining redress through the Court of Claims; and whereas, in the United States circuit court for the district of South Carolina, August term, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, in the case of McLeod versus Callicott, a United States Treasury agent, the Chief Justice of the United States decided that all cotton seized after the thirtieth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, was unauthorized, and, therefore, illegal, and that the owner of such property was entitled to recover the market value thereof at the time of seizure, with lawful interest from date; and whereas the Solicitor and the Attorney General of the United States have fully recognized the decision of the Chief Justice of the United States as the law in the premises; and whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of the steamer Cotton Plant, unanimously decided that cotton seized after the cessation of hostilities was, \"not captured or prize cotton,\" therefore illegal, and directed its restoration; and whereas the twelfth section of the act of Congress approved July twenty-third, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, directs the Secretary of the Treasury to refund to the lawful owners all moneys erroneously received and erroneously covered into the Treasury: Therefore,",

That on that day the said Elston, intending to convey the land so donated, executed a deed to the United States for a piece or parcel of ground, and by mistake described it as follows: \"All that tract or parcel of land situate, lying, and being in the county of Laporte, in the State of Indiana, and in and part of section twenty-nine in township thirty-eight north, range four west, bounded as follows, namely: beginning at a point twenty feet west of a stake stuck for the site of a light-house, and from thence south one hundred and thirty feet to a stake, and from thence east one hundred and seventy-five feet to a stake, and from thence north to Lake Michigan two hundred and sixty feet; thence west with the margin of the lake one hundred and seventy-five feet, and from thence south to the place of beginning.\" That the United States soon after the execution of said deed took possession of the ground first above described and so intended to be conveyed, and built a light-house thereon inclosed it with a fence, and thence hitherto have held the exclusive possession thereof, and have never asserted title to any other property under said deed; and Whereas the said Elston was the owner of all the land adjoining said ground and retained possession thereof, and afterward sold and conveyed the same to innocent purchasers, who, or those claiming under such conveyances, caused the same to be platted and laid out into town-lots as an addition to Michigan City, and which said town-lots were laid out with reference to the land so taken possession of and fenced by the United States, and which said land and town-lots are now held and possessed in good faith by the remote vendees of said Elston: Now, therefore, For the purpose of correcting said mistake and releasing all right, title, or interest which the United States may have by virtue of the error in said deed of said Elston: Therefore,",

R. S. Canby, for permission to institute an action in the United States district court for the recovery thereof, and was refused, and was assured by said department commander that the possession of said cotton would be forcibly maintained; and Whereas when the United States restored said cotton to its lawful owner, said Henry Ware, it was deficient in quantity and inferior in quality, and was worth fifty-three thousand nine hundred and seventy-one dollars and sixty-one cents less than when so seized, and the United States compelled said Ware to pay excessive and unlawful charges on said cotton, amounting to ten thousand eight hundred and forty-two dollars and thirty-one cents, as the condition of the restoration thereof; and Whereas the owner of said cotton having, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, instituted an action for the recovery of the difference in the value of the same at the time of the seizure, and the time of the restoration thereof, and also of said excessive charges, against the agents of the United States, in a State court of Louisiana, the said department commander, on the twenty-fourth day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, issued his order prohibiting said court from entertaining jurisdiction of said action, but afterward, on the fourteenth day of May, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized said court to entertain such jurisdiction, and the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States employed attorneys and counsel who defended said action, and judgment therein was rendered for said Ware for the difference in the value of said cotton when seized and when restored, and for the charges so paid, amounting in the aggregate to sixty-four thousand eight hundred and thirteen dollars and ninety-two cents, with interest and costs, and no part of said judgment has ever been paid: Therefore,",

Whereas our public lands contain mines of the precious metals which are unsurpassed in extent, and can, with proper development, be made speedily to enhance the value of all property, and thereby relieve the burdens of the people; and Whereas a wise policy indicates that the revenue derived from our mineral lands should, to some extent, be devoted again to the much-needed development of that important interest; and Whereas Congress, by an act approved July twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, authorized the construction of a draining and exploring tunnel to the Comstock lode, in the State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro certain rights and privileges, which have been assigned, transferred, and set over to a corporation, duly organized under the laws of the State of California, and known as the Sutro Tunnel Company; and Whereas great benefits will accrue to the people of the United States from the construction of said tunnel, which, as a great geological survey, penetrating into an argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than has yet been reached by any similar work in the world, will establish the value of our mineral domain; and Whereas the principal wealth of our mineral regions consists in low-grade ores, which can only be utilized by means of improved reduction, concentration, and smelting works, for the erection of which extraordinary facilities exist at the mouth of said tunnel; and Whereas this work bears a national character, and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of private enterprise, and the security offered to the Government is ample for the repayment of any sums to be advanced under this act: Therefore,",

Mr. Packard, on leave, introduced the following bill: A Bill To authorize the President of the United States to request the republic of Hayti to indemnify Antonio Pelletier. Whereas Antonio Pelletier, a citizen of the United States, naturalized in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-two, did, during the month of August or September, eighteen hundred and sixty, purchase of a United States marshal, at public auction, at the port of Key West, the bark William; and the subsequently the said Pelletier shipped a crew and placed a cargo of merchandise on board the said vessel and proceeded on a trading voyage to the West Indies; and that while in pursuance of his said legitimate commercial enterprise his said vessel, under stress of weather, was cast upon a reef, designated as Caico, off the coast of Hayti, in the mouth of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, and after drifting for several days the bark came to anchor in the port of Fort Liberte, Hayti; and that after making some slight repairs, and being informed that the port of Fort Liberte was not open to commerce, anchor was weighed and the bark proceeded down the bay until near the fort, when the prevailing breeze failed, and the vessel drifted on the reef opposite the fort, where the tide left her high and dry, when certain authorities of the republic of Hayti boarded the said bark William, arrested the said Antonio Pelletier and his crew, and carried them ashore and consigned them to prison, without cause or proper trial, holding the said Pelletier, the master and owner of the vessel aforesaid, a close prisoner for the period of nearly three years, condemning him to death, and subjecting him to the most cruel treatment, from which he finally escaped by the assistance of the agents of foreign governments; and that during his imprisonment his said vessel and cargo were seized and confiscated by the authorities of the republic of Hayti; and that his said imprisonment, spoliation, and consequent losses amounted to the financial damages of the said Pelletier in the sum of six hundred and thirteen thousand eight hundred dollars; and further, that the imprisonment and inhuman treatment to which the said Pelletier was subjected resulted in the serious impairing of his health, and rendered him an invalid and crippled for life, for which afflictions it is almost impossible to estimate in moneyed damages; and Whereas the facts above recited are evidenced by executive document numbered two hundred and sixty, second session of the Fortieth Congress, furnished by the Secretary of State in response to House resolution of the tenth March, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight: Now, therefore,",
