    "description": "Ordered to be printed. Amended, as proposed by Mr. Davis, of Massachusetts, as modified on the motion of Mr. Lewis. Note.--The preamble, and the provisos proposed by Mr. Lewis and accepted by Mr. Davis, being in italics. A Bill To enable the President of the United States to take temporary military occupation of Yucatan. Whereas, an exterminating war is now being waged by the Indian upon the white population of Yucatan, which, if not arrested, threatens the extinction of the white race; and whereas, Yucatan, as one of the States of Mexico, is entitled to the protection of the Mexican government; and whereas, by reason of the existing war, the authority of the Mexican government has been, to a great extent, suppressed within the limits of Mexico, and the military authority of the United States substituted in its stead; and whereas, to such substitution is to be mainly attributed the impunity which is now given to cruelty and outrage on the part of the insurgents, justice and good faith to Yucatan, as well as the existing armistice with Mexico, require, as in the case of other Indian invasions of Mexican territory during the war, that the United States, having superseded the power of Mexico, should assume the protection of Yucatan, until Mexico shall be in a condition to re-assume the same.",
