Amendment Intended to be proposed by Mr. Doolittle to the bill (S. 497) \"making appropriation to facilitate the acquisition of Cuba by negotiation,\" viz; Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the following: Whereas the proposition contained in the message of the President of the United States in relation to the purchase of the island of Cuba has already been considered and has been unanimously rejected by the Spanish government, and a resolution of the chamber of deputies, unanimously passed, and concurred in by all parties, has been ordered to be inscribed in their archives, and a similar resolution has also been passed by the senate, with such declarations, and accompanied by such language, as to demonstrate that any attempt by the government of the United States to purchase the island of Cuba at the present time would be not only unwise and impracticable, but offensive to the national pride of that government and people, and well calculated to induce that government to enter into treaties with France and England, by which she may engage never to cede that island to the United States, under any circumstances and for any consideration; and whereas, in the progress of events, from our geographical position and relations to the States of Mexico, Central and South America, and from our expanding commerce, important questions of national policy in relation to them are pressing upon us and must be met and determined; and whereas the policy recommended by the President in his annual message, and pursued by this administration, is well calculated to impress upon the people of these States a well grounded apprehension that it is the policy of this government to devote all its energies to the extension of slavery into those tropical regions, and such apprehension has alienated from the United States the people of all those States; and whereas it is our true policy to reassure them that the government of the United States will not pursue towards them any such policy, nor in any manner attempt to overturn their domestic policy by re-establishing slavery among them; and whereas the numerous disabilities to which free persons of color of African descent are subjected in many of the free States have made it desirable, on the part of large numbers of them, to seek elsewhere a more favorable field for their labor and enterprise; and whereas the same class of persons is regarded with still greater disfavor in the slave holding States, from considerations deemed so controlling that further emancipation in many of them has been prohibited by law, unless the persons emancipated shall be at the same time removed beyond the jurisdiction of the State, and in some of them the graver question is seriously entertained whether persons of African descent, who are now free, shall not again be reduced to slavery if they continue to remain within their jurisdictions; and whereas in Yucatan and Central and South America there are vast regions, almost uninhabited, of the most beautiful and productive countries in the world, in a climate well adapted to the constitution of the African race, to develop its greatest power and highest activity; and whereas it may possibly happen that an immediate payment of money will be called for by the stipulations of any treaty which may be entered into: Therefore--",
