Whereas doubts have arisen in the construction of the act of Congress, passed the second of March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one, entitled ''An act to reduce and fix the Military Peace Establishment of the United States,'' which have hitherto prevented it from being carried into execution, so far as relates to the arrangement of a Colonel to the Second Regiment of Artillery: And Whereas it was the true intent and meaning of the said act, that the vacancy aforesaid should be filled by arranging to it one of the Colonels in the Army of the United States, at the time of the passage thereof: And Whereas, in the execution of said act, Daniel Bissell, then a Colonel in the line, and a Brevet Brigadier General in the Army of the United States, was ordered to be discharged as a supernumerary officer; which order, as it affected the said Daniel Bissell, and some other officers, was held, by the Senate to be illegal and void: And Whereas the President of the United States has since nominated the said Daniel Bissell to be Colonel of the Second Regiment of Artillery aforesaid, which nomination the Senate have not acted upon, because they hold the said Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Daniel Bissell to be in the Army, and to need no new appointment: Now, therefore, to put an end to all doubt and disagreement upon this subject, and to enable the President to carry said act of March second, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-one, into execution,",
