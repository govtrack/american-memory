Elston, on the twenty-fifth day of June, eighteen hundred and thirty-five, agreed to donate to the United States a piece or parcel of ground in Michigan City, in the State of Indiana, for a light-house, said piece or parcel of land to be two hundred and sixty feet long and one hundred and seventy-five feet wide, the courses of the lines to run parallel to the streets in said city. That on that day the said Elston, intending to convey the land so donated, executed a deed to the United States for a piece or parcel of ground, and by mistake described it as follows: ""All that tract or parcel of land situate, lying, and being in the county of Laporte, in the State of Indiana, and in and part of section twenty-nine in township thirty-eight north, range four west, bounded as follows, namely: beginning at a point twenty feet west of a stake stuck for the site of a light-house, and from thence south one hundred and thirty feet to a stake, and from thence east one hundred and seventy-five feet to a stake, and from thence north to Lake Michigan two hundred and sixty feet; thence west with the margin of the lake one hundred and seventy-five feet, and from thence south to the place of beginning."" That the United States soon after the execution of said deed took possession of the ground first above described and so intended to be conveyed, and built a light-house thereon inclosed it with a fence, and thence hitherto have held the exclusive possession thereof, and have never asserted title to any other property under said deed; and Whereas the said Elston was the owner of all the land adjoining said ground and retained possession thereof, and afterward sold and conveyed the same to innocent purchasers, who, or those claiming under such conveyances, caused the same to be platted and laid out into town-lots as an addition to Michigan City, and which said town-lots were laid out with reference to the land so taken possession of and fenced by the United States, and which said land and town-lots are now held and possessed in good faith by the remote vendees of said Elston: Now, therefore, For the purpose of correcting said mistake and releasing all right, title, or interest which the United States may have by virtue of the error in said deed of said Elston: Therefore,","Committee on Private Land-Claims"
