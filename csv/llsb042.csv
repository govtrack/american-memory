Smyth, of the city of Wilmington, Delaware, on the breaking out of the rebellion in eighteen hundred and sixty-one, raised a company of men and tendered them for three months' service to the United States, in answer to the call of President Lincoln for seventy-five thousand volunteers; after serving three months, he returned to Wilmington, Delaware, with his company, and was mustered into the volunteer service of the United States as major of the First Delaware Regiment; soon afterward the First Delaware left for the seat of war, and Major Thomas A. Smyth, who was with the regiment in all its memorable engagements, was promoted for gallant and meritorious conduct on the battle-field, as follows: To lieutenant-colonel, December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-two; to colonel, March nineteenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-three; to brigadier-general, October first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and to brevet major-general, on the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and died at Burkesville, Virginia, on the ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, from wounds received at the battle of Farmville, Virginia, two days previous; and Whereas the said Brevet Major-General Thomas A. Smyth was actively engaged in the military service of the Republic during the whole of the late civil war, until he fell at the head of his column mortally wounded, leading the advance of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the very last charge, and in the last great fight of the seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, previous to the surrender of the rebel General R. E. Lee; and Whereas the said General Thomas A.
