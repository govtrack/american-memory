Whereas the rebellion lately waged by the people of the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, against the government of the United States, deprived the people of the above-named States of all rightful civil government; and whereas the said rebellion did not deprive the government of the United States of its constitutional jurisdiction over the territory of said States, and over the people thereof; and whereas the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government; and whereas the restoration of the above-named States to the possession and exercise of political and representative power as members of the federal Union, under governments republican in form, is a duty which appertains, under the Constitution, to the Congress of the United States; and whereas Congress is solemnly bound to assume the responsibility of this work of reconstruction, and to employ, if need be, all its powers for its successful consummation, and to take care that in the performance of this duty loyalty is advanced and protected everywhere throughout the States lately in rebellion, and that the new governments to be established are founded upon the fundamental truths that all men are equal in rights, and that all just governments stand only on the consent of the governed; and because the measures for reconstruction which originated in the executive power of the government have failed to accomplish the necessary ends, but on the contrary have resulted in the establishment of governments in the above-named States, derived from that hostile population lately engaged in armed rebellion, in the exclusion, as a general rule, of loyal men from office, and in the denial of civil and political rights to large masses of loyal citizens, so that treason is made respectable and loyalty a disgrace; and because almost all of the governments of the above-named States, so established through executive agency, have rejected, and the remainder failed to ratify, wholesome and necessary amendments of the national Constitution, proposed by Congress in a spirit of kindness, with a view to reconstruction, and the more effectually to secure union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, and extend the blessings of liberty, by which course the said governments have manifested a spirit of opposition to the declared objects of the Constitution: Therefore,","Committee on Reconstruction"
